<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>In
Atari's early days, one of the video game designers and his rather odd
friend worked many late nights on a new arcade game called "Breakout".&nbsp;&nbsp;
While working on this new video game and playing other arcade games all
through the night these two friends were busy on the side designing and
building (from "borrowed" Atari parts) a personal computer system.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They approached Nolan Bushnell with their new creation to see if it would
be a product that Atari would sell and support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the
time Atari was concentrating on getting its new home version of Pong out
the door and all resources were tied up, with no spare capital to devout
to such a costly and risky product, Nolan Bushnell referred the two budding
entrepreneurs to some venture capitalists to finance their new product.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who was this former Atari employee?&nbsp;&nbsp; None other then the current
iCEO of Apple, Steve Jobs.&nbsp; Who was his rather odd friend?&nbsp; Steve
"The Woz" Wozniak and their creation was the Apple Computer.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1978 the team that had finished the Atari VCS was at work on a new high-end
video game console chipset.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari was now owned by Warner
Communications since its sale in 1976 by its original owner/creator Nolan
Bushnell for $28 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari was now run by Raymond
Kassar who wanted Atari to compete in the home computer market against
Apple and its Apple ][e computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new high-end chipset
was "frozen" for use only in the newly created Atari Home Computer Division.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari's new Home Computer Division was so hastily started that office trailers
were brought in and set-up behind Atari's offices while work progressed
on the new computer designs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Working in these rather cramped
quarters Atari's new HCD engineers &amp; designers went to work on designing
the worlds first computers to use custom IC's to handle graphics, sound
and communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari's first two computers were called
the Atari 400 and Atari 800 Personal Computer Systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These computers had a large assortment of "Intelligent" peripherals which
communicated through a custom bus called the "SIO" (Serial I/O) which compared
to today standards is a rather simplistic version of the USB (Universal
Serial Bus).&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact the USB and the Atari SIO have a lot more
in common then many would think.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of Atari's original computer
engineers, Joe Decuir who created the Atari SIO bus is also one of the
team of engineers at Microsoft to help design and holds patents on the
USB.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Atari 400/800 line was cancelled in 1982 to be replaced by a new sleek
high-tech looking computer called the Atari 1200XL.&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer
had an incompatible OS, no external expansion bus and little enhancements
over the original 400/800 line and due to these shortcommings, the sales
of the Atari 800 computer increased while people rushed to buy them before
supplies ran out.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1200XL was quickly replaced by the Atari
600/800XL line of computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These computers fixed many
of the 1200XL's shortcommings, had a Parallel Bus Interface for external
expansion options.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several other computers were planned with
voice synthesisers, built-in modems and built in disk drives but were never
officially sold.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the works in 1983, Atari had several new high-end computers including
one called the 1600XL which would be a dual processor system with 6502
and 80186 for IBM compatibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another System called "Sierra"
with a high-end audio/video chipset based on the MC68000 processor.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet another project in the works was another system called "Gaza" which
also used a high-end chipset and MC68000 processor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These
systems would never make it past prototyping as Atari would be sold in
1984.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On July 2, 1984 Atari's Consumer Electronics Division and its Home Computer
Division were sold to Tramiel Technologies Limited and the company was
renamed Atari Corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari XL line of computers
was cancelled and in 1985 a new line of computers to replace the XL line
called the Atari 65XE and 130XE computers were introduced.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari also introduced an all new line of computers called the Atari ST
line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These new computers would use the Motorola
68000 processor, come with 512K of memory, use 3.5" disk drives, RGB monitors
and a graphics user environment based on CP/M 68K and Digital Research
GEM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally the processor for this new line of computers
was to be the National 32032, however its availability was in doubt, so
the MC68000 was chosen.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari would, over the course of 8 years improve upon its ST line of computers
with such lines as the Mega ST, STe, Mega STe, TT030 and Falcon030 line
of computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari also introduced a laptop called the STacy
and had in the works an under 5 lb. laptop called the STBook as its replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A pen based touch tablet version of the ST had been shown in prototype
form but was never sold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari introduced an assortment
of peripherals from disk drives to laser printers for its line of ST computers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1987 Atari introduced a line of IBM compatible computer systems starting
with its Atari PC-1 which was an all-in-one IBM XT compatible computer
with built in disk drive, built in serial, parallel, keyboard, mouse and
video ports (video could be configured for cga, Hercules, EGA and other
settings).&nbsp;&nbsp; An internal bus port on the motherboard allowed
for an expansion card to use the Atari Mega ST "Megafile" hard disk system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari also introduced other PC compatible systems as well as a 386sx laptop
and also an IBM XT palmtop computer the size of a VHS video tape.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Atari Falcon030 was Atari last computer
system to be produced.&nbsp;&nbsp; All company resources were directed
towards the creation and completion of Atari's 64-bit Interactive Multimedia
System called the Atari Jaguar 64 which was sold in 1993.</font>
