&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first versions of the Atari
850's used black metal cases with white graphics drawn onto the cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are no physical differences in the actual motherboard contained inside
of the case compared to the standard 850's which used the beige plastic
cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari at the time may not have decided how they were
going to package there peripherals or just hadn't finalized on how they
wanted the 850 case to look.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another possibility may have been
for RF reasons, Atari was overly concerned about passing FCC testing (note
the excessive use of thick die-cast shielding in the Atari 400/800 computers)
and may have packaged the 850 in all metal for fear that since it was an
interface system it may have generated excessive RF noise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 850 came out of Lawrence
Livermore Laboratories.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has a Z-80 processor, 6532 and does
not utilize the rear RS-232c ports of the unit even though they were included.&nbsp;&nbsp;
it has a IEEE-488 interface and well as a serial cable.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
unit was used to measure seismic readings.
