The Atari 835 direct connect modem was a welcomed product for Atari computer
users who wanted to connect onto on-line services, Bulletin Board Systems
or other on-line systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 835 required
no special interface and plugged directly into the Atari SIO bus along
with all the other Atari peripherals.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 835 did not
require the expensive Atari 850 Interface module like the Atari 830 modem
and other 3rd party modems required.</font></font>

The Atari 835 modem came with Atari Telelink II which was a cartridge based
ROM program that plugged into the Atari 400/800 computer to use the Atari
835 modem.&nbsp;&nbsp; It offered auto-dial which was wonderful (no more
manually dialing the same number over and over becuase of busy signals)
and also it had a truly unique and powerful feature.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari
Telelink II cartridge could store 2 most frequently used telephones numbers
in the ROM cartridge itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even to this day, the 2
telephone numbers which were stored in one of the Atari Historical Society's
cartridges from almost 15 years ago is still in-tact!!!</font></font>

Chemical bank and Atari worked together on designing an all-in-one On-line
banking system called PRONTO(tm) which used a custom ROM cartidge that
brought up a Pronto dial-up screen and using an Atari computer with the
Atari 835 modem (later the package included the newer Atari 1030 modem),
Atari users could perform on-line banking.</font></font>
