This is where the Atari computer systems all began.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
original prototypes that were to become known as the Atari 400 and Atari
800 computers were originally called in Atari during the prototype stages
as "OZ" Computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on after the prototypes received
their official names, the Atari 400 was nicknamed "Candy" and the Atari
800 was nicknamed "Colleen".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 400 was
meant to be a beginners system for young children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its touch
sensitive membrane keyboard was to help keep children from dropping food,
drinks and small objects in between the keys which would have damaged the
keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its design was simple and elegant with its attractive
wedge shape, to the simple flip-up cartridge port the Atari 400 was a cute
and fun 16K beginners computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 800 was for
the more serious minded home computer user.&nbsp;&nbsp; With its full stroke
keyboard to its dual cartridge ports and expansion slots the Atari 800
was meant to be a powerful, useful and expandable system, even its OS board
could be easily removed and replaced with newer and more powerful Operating
Systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 800 initially came with 8K of memory
and was quickly upgraded to a standard 16K, then Atari sold the system
with a full 48K and offered current owners free upgrades at authorized
Atari Service Centers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 800 was a truly wonderful
home computer system.</font>

During the years of 1979 through 1982 while the Atari 400/800 computers
were sold, many enhancements were sold for these computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Such enhancements included replacement keyboards for the Atari 400,&nbsp;
Memory upgrades from 16K to 1MB, 80 Column video cards,&nbsp; Operating
System Replacements, Networkable hard drives, and many many other enhancements.&nbsp;&nbsp;
(There was even a rumor of an actual modem card that went into Slot #3
on the Atari 800).</font>
