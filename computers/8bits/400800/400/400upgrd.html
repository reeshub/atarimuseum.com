The Atari 400 could have just as much memory as the Atari 800 with this
factory upgrade kit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The upgrade required soldering several
wires to the underside of theAtari 400 motherboard, not too difficult a
job for those who were handy with a soldering iron.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still Atari
did not sell these directly to the public for fear that users would damage
the system board or void the warantee of the computer.</FONT>
