						<p align="justify"><b><font size="4" face="Arial">The Atari 400, also known as 
			"Candy" was Atari's second computer released in 1979 along with her 
			big sister, the Atari 800 which was known as "Colleen".</font></b></p>

					<blockquote>
						<p align="justify"><b><font size="4" face="Arial">The Atari 400 was also referred 
			to as "The Basic Computer." It was meant to be an entry level 
			computer but it was a computer in search of its real purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Candy was meant to be a video game system with a computer keyboard, 
			but last minute decisions changed its design to be a low end 
			computer and less of a video game system.</font></b></p>
						<p align="justify"><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Candy, just like Colleen would 
			have a rather unique case design.&nbsp; Douglas Hardy who was the 
			co-designer of the original Atari 2600 VCS console designed the very 
			unique and elegantly high tech looking case for the Atari 400.&nbsp; 
			It too had a 2mm thick aluminum RF shield over its internal 
			electronic components and this also compromised part of the Atari 
			400 case.&nbsp; When opening the cartridge door, the user could see 
			the aluminum chassis within.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cartridge door on the 
			Atari 400, just as on the Atari 800, had a safety switch that turned 
			off the computer when the door was opened to protect it from 
			accidentally inserting or removing the ROM cartridges from the 
			cartridge bay within.</font></b></p>

					<blockquote>
						<p align="justify"><b><font size="4" face="Arial">The Atari 400's originally 
			shipped with 8k but that was changed very quickly to 16k.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			The unit has an SIO (Serial I/O connection port on the side) for 
			connecting Tape drives, modems and printers.&nbsp; To use more 
			advanced programs and disk drives the Atari 400 would need to have 
			more RAM memory added.&nbsp; Unlike the Atari 800 which had an 
			easily accessible expansion bay to instead memory modules into, the 
			Atari 400 would have to be physically opening to have larger memory 
			installed</font></b></p>
						<p align="justify"><b><font size="4" face="Arial">The Atari 400's lack a 
			composite video monitor port on them and can only be connected to a 
			TV through an RF connector.&nbsp; Since the system was meant to 
			really be more video game console than computer, the keyboard is a 
			kid friendly membrane keyboard which is meant for just casual key 
			presses, not for touch typing.&nbsp; Using it for Word Processing, On-line communications usage or 
                        Programming becomes cumbersome, 
			tiring and frustrating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several companies did release 
			keyboard upgrades for the Atari 400 though.</font></b></p>
