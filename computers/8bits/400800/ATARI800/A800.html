          about the famous Atari PCS’ (Personal Computer Systems) called the 
          Atari 400 and the Atari 800.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both had codenames:&nbsp; Candy for the 400 
          and Colleen for the 800.&nbsp; Internally their original model #’s were the 
          C7000 for the Atari 400 and the C8000 for the Atari 800.&nbsp; Their model 
          #’s would be changed to be their price points:&nbsp; $400 for the Atari 400 
          and $800 for the Atari 800.</font></p>

						<font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;How did the Atari 
          PCS computers come into existence?&nbsp; Well, sit back and let’s take a 
          walk back in time to 1977 and discuss their origins, the Atari 2600. 
          The Atari 2600 VCS (Video Computer System) would make its debut in the 
          summer of 1977 to rather surprised crowds at the Summer CES (Consumer 
          Electronics Show) when Atari unveiled their marvel of technology. &nbsp;It 
          had been kept well hidden so as not to allow it to fall into the hands 
          of Magnavox, who under a court settlement that Atari agreed to, would 
          have access to any Atari technology in development up to a certain 
          date.&nbsp; So the Atari 2600 VCS would be shown after the date and freed 
          Atari from having to turn over its technological wonder to Magnavox to 
          exploit at Atari’s cost.</font></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;While crowds were 
          being amazed by the wonders of the Atari 2600 and retailers were 
          crushing to place orders with Atari to get this incredible new video 
          game console into their stores, Atari’s engineers who created the 
          Atari 2600 VCS were happily smiling at how well received their new 
          creation was, but not content with their creation. They wanted it to 
          do more.</font></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;Something they all 
          wanted was character generation, better resolution graphics and more 
          advanced features for input and storage. Steve Mayer, Larry Nicholson, 
          Joe Decuir and Jay Miner all started to contemplate what would be 
          possible.&nbsp; Steve Mayer met with Nolan Bushnell and Joe Keenan and 
          asked what they wanted this new system to be.&nbsp; Nolan and Joe said they 
          wanted it to be both a computer and a video game system.&nbsp; They wanted 
          a device to compete against Apple, but also wanted a device that would 
          be a successor to the Atari VCS.</font></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">Project Colleen would 
          be started.&nbsp; Improve the TIA chip, the Television Interface Adapter 
          which is the heart of the Atari 2600 VCS, allow it to display higher 
          resolution graphics and more colors on the screen, give it Player 
          Missile Graphics capabilities and other advanced functions. The CTIA 
			would be born. (Computer Television Interface Adapter) and along 
			with it a DMA (Direct Memory Access) chip called ANTIC which was 
			short for the Alpha-Numeric Television Interface Chip.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			For sound, Keyboard and communications the POKEY chip (Potentiometer 
			Keyboard) chip was developed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rounding things out, these 
			three custom chips would be put together with a full blown 6502C CPU 
			chip and a 6520 PIA (Parallel 
          Interface Adapter) which would interface the 4 front controller ports and allow 
          high speed parallel I/O interfacing as well.</font></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">Later Atari would 
          release an upgrade to the CTIA called the GTIA which would add more 
          graphics modes and more colors to the Atari PCS computers.</font></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;The new chipset was 
          being defined and developed and the Mechanical engineers and 
          Industrial Designers got to work to give these new devices a really 
          great appearance.&nbsp; John Ellis would define the overall designs of the 
          system while Kevin McKinsey and Atari VCS case co-designer Douglas 
          Hardy would design the looks for the Colleen and Candy. Kevin 
          specifically wanted to give users a very familiar and friendly feel to 
          the Colleen, so the design would be similar the home typewriters of 
          the day.&nbsp; The design worked out very well, hiding some of its more 
          advanced capabilities such as its ROM access bay for Cartridge based 
          software such as BASIC and the Talk and Teach cartridges.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then with 
          a few simple thumb latches the OS and Memory bay was revealed. 
          Something the common user wouldn’t immediately notice was the built in 
          Power-off safety switch in the front cartridge bay, once opened the 
          Atari 800 would automatically turn off, once the door was closed to 
          the cartridge bay, the system would boot back up.&nbsp; A very smart 
          feature to ensure no accidental insertion or removal of cartridges 
          and/or OS or Memory modules might damage the system or possibly hurt 
          the user.</font></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">The OS and Memory 
          modules were located in a fortress of an expansion bay, surrounded by 
          2mm thick aluminum chassis which also doubled as part of the Atari 
          800’s case structure.&nbsp; The expansion bays would be covered under a 
          plastic guide cover which only exposed the expansion headers and 
          completely separated the user from directly coming in contact with the 
          electronics underneath. A very well thought out design which really 
          differentiated the Atari 800 from other systems such as the Apple ][ 
          and the early S-100 bus computers which exposed users to live current 
          when the case was open and direct contact with all of the electronics 
          and power components within the computers.</font></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">While these Expansion 
          bays were innovative, they were also a major thorn in the over all 
          design of the Atari 800 because at the time the FCC rules were so 
          strict and Atari was so cautious to never violate them, to have a 
          computer system with expansion bays that would emit large amounts of 
          RF (Radio Frequency,) a form of electronic “noise” that could disrupt 
          a Television signal and even create audio noise on nearby radios, was 
          something Atari engineers couldn’t risk.&nbsp; The solution – build a 
          computer where almost all of its components would be encased inside an 
          aluminum RF shield that was akin to an electronic EMP (electro 
          magnetic pulse) bomb shelter, called a Faraday Cage.&nbsp; And with it, its 
          expansion modules would be inside plastic/metal enclosures nestled in 
          an expansion bay with a top that also had an aluminum shield under it 
          to cover and seal the expansion modules in their RF Tomb.&nbsp; Talk about 
          over engineering a solution.</font></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial" size="4">Candy would have a 
          scaled down, non-expansion bay version of this same RF cocoon as well. 
          Atari engineers wanted slots, real slots, like Apple ][ type slots, 
          but this didn’t happen.&nbsp; Sadly the timing was just wrong for Atari, 
          just as the Atari 400 and Atari 800 computers would begin production, 
          the FCC in October 1979 would relax rules regarding Part 15 in regards 
          to computers. This change in the FCC rule essentially freed Atari to 
          be able to produce exactly the computer that the engineers had wanted 
          from the very beginning of the project, ones with fully useable and 
          externally accessible expansion slots.&nbsp; It was too late, however. Once 
          the Atari 400 and 800 were completed, Atari engineers Jay Miner and 
          Joe Decuir had penciled out a block design for the next follow up to 
          the Atari 400 and 800 that could be ready in 2-3 years.&nbsp; It would be 
          based on the stunningly powerful new Motorola 68000 processor and the 
          Atari GTIA, ANTIC and POKEY chipset would all be enhanced further in 
          the 16 bit realm of computing, giving Atari a future path to continue 
          to be at the forefront of technology. Atari shot down this request 
          from the two visionary engineers, since the new computers had just 
          cost the company over $10 million in development and weren’t even on 
          retailer shelves yet and Atari was unsure if this risky new venture 
          into home PC’s was even going to see them recoup all of their R&amp;D 
          investment.&nbsp; So the two engineers decided to wait till the Atari 400 
          and 800 began rolling off the assembly lines and then quit to move 
          onto other ventures, but firmly committed to making the next 
          generation computer a reality.&nbsp; Eventually they did.&nbsp; It’s called the 
          Amiga.</font></p>
