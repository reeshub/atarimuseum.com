					<font face="Arial" size="4">The Atari 800 
          expansion bays were originally meant for just an OS &quot;Personality Card&quot; 
          and up to 3 16K Memory modules to give the computer system a total of 
          48K which for a computer system in 1979, was a very large amount of 
          memory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also the CPU of the the system, the 8-bit 6502 
          processor was capable of a total of 64K of linear memory, so giving 
          the system 48K was an admiral amount of memory for this budding new 
          computer system.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;However some 
          interesting things were hidden in those expansion bays.&nbsp; 
          Capabilities that even the very engineers who designed it never saw 
          possible at the time. However just as programmers had unlocked 
          numerous unknown capabilities to make the little Atari 2600 VCS do 
          magical and wonderful graphics that were never thought even remotely 
          possible when it was designed, so too were some magical secrets and 
          powerful capabilities just waiting to be unlocked within the Atari 
          800.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial" size="4">Companies such as 
          Axlon, Mosiac, Intec, Newell, BIT-3, Austin Frankin, CMC and many 
          others would develop and sell an assortment of OS boards, memory 
          upgrade boards, RAMdisk boards (the very first SSD drives), Video 
          boards and Parallel/Serial boards.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial" size="4">Even today on the 
          Internet's most active Atari community:&nbsp;
          			<a href="http://www.atariage.com"><font color="#000000">http://www.atariage.com</font></a>&nbsp; there are dozens of 
          independent and small group hardware hackers continually developing 
          new boards for the Atari 800, everything from the original MYIDE 
          boards to Incognito OS boards to RAM boards, some have IDE hard drive 
          interfacing, others even have Western Digital 65816 CPU upgrades 
          bringing the Atari 800's into the 16-bit world of computing at up to 
          7mhz of speed.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial" size="4">The Atari 400 and 
          Atari 800 computers also have another very special expansion system 
          called SIO (Serial I/O) which is a very early version of what would 
          eventually become USB which is used today.&nbsp; An interesting fact: 
          The designer of the SIO port is Atari engineer Joe Decuir who is 
          today, one of the patent holders of the USB interface, so it would 
          seem his design would continue to evolve and in a sense ever PC and 
          MAC user has a little bit of Atari in their systems today, thanks to 
          Joe.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial" size="4">The SIO, just like 
          today's USB allowed a great amount of power and flexibility to be 
          added to the Atari 400 and Atari 800 computers.&nbsp; Connecting 
          devices (called Daisy chaining, essentially plugging one device into 
          the next and next and so forth) onto this SIO chain allowed for the 
          use of everything from Disk Drives, tape drives, Printers, I/O boxes 
          with Serial and Pararell ports, Voice synthesisers, MIDI interfaces 
          and other devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; The downside to the SIO design was that 
          is was an intelligent communications system, and each device required 
          its own CPU to communicate and work on the SIO bus, so this made the 
          devices inherently expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other downside to the 
          SIO bus was its speed: 19.2K communication rate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though 
          later hardware hackers were able to push the SIO to 38.4K speeds which 
          greatly helped.</font></p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial" size="4">Another avenue of 
          Expansion for the Atari 400 and Atari 800 computers were its front 
          controller ports.&nbsp; This were connected to the PIA chip (Parallel 
          Interface Adapter) and many devices such as Modems, Real Time clocks 
          and voice synthesisers used these ports.&nbsp;&nbsp; Corvus Systems, 
          makers of Hard drives and networking systems had an interface box that 
          plugged into Controller Ports 3 &amp; 4 on the Atari 800 and allowed the 
          computer to use a hard disk system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Corvus also sold boxes 
          called MUX's that allowed multiple Atari 800's with Corvus interface 
          boxes to plug into the same hard disk.&nbsp; Up to 8 mux's could plug 
          into a single 8 port mux allowing for a whopping total of 64 Atari 
          800's to be able to connect to and boot from a single Corvus disk 
          system.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial" size="4">Once such commercial 
          installation of a 64 Atari 800 computer mux network was set-up at 
          Fordham Prepatory School in the Bronx, NY.&nbsp;&nbsp; Run by Father 
          Nick Lombardi, this network ran for many years.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
          complimentary 3rd party OS board designed by David Small called The 
          Integrator, replaced the Atari OS board and allowed the Atari 800's it 
          was installed into to boot directly from a Corvus hard drive without 
          the need of booting from Atari 810 or other floppy disk drive to load 
          the Corvus driver to access the hard disk through the front controller 
          ports.</font></p>
