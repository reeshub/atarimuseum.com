&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 800D was a developers
system which comprised several parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first part was a
CPU card (not an OS card from Slot #0) that had a ribbon cable that feed
to the empty part of the right side of a normal Atari 800.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Atari 800D had in that section an interface adapter, the ribbon cable
plugged into that adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Power was feed to the interface
adapter from a hand solder pair of wires from the power board.&nbsp; The
interface has a RESET switch, external ribbon cable connector which feed
to an S-100 card (More information below) and also what appear to be 2
DIP switch programmable serial ports.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a ribbon cable from the
right side interface adapter feed into this S-100 bus interface card which
is essentially an Atari 800 on a card (well sorta).&nbsp;&nbsp; The card
contains a PIA, POKEY, CTIA or GTIA and ANTIC chips.&nbsp;&nbsp; These
boards were used in Crememco S-100 systems (If you wanted to find the 2nd
largest source of Crememco equipment you'd come to Atari, they had hundreds
upon hundreds of them, the 1st largest source would have been Crememco
itself).&nbsp;&nbsp; These boards were used early on for writing new software
for the Atari 400/800 systems.
