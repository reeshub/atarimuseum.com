<FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long before Atari
introduced "AtariWriter", it famous wordprocessor on a cartridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari had come out with The Atari Word Processor.&nbsp;&nbsp; This program
had some very powerful and unique features and included a tutorial on cassette
tapes included with the package.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The documentation was
quite extensive as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; You needed all the documentation and
the casettes because this wordprocessor was both feature rich and powerful.&nbsp;
(Hmmm, when using this package, it has a very professional look and feel
to it, perhaps Atari was rethinking its decision about the home market
and was perhaps rethinking the small business market?).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It had 80 column auto return mode on it as well as on editing with simulaneous
on-screen print preview and many other ahead of its time features.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Few people know about this product so we felt it was worth mentioning.</FONT>
