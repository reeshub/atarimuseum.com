&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installing additional
memory into the Atari 800 couldn't have been any easier.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply
open the cartridge door (which automatically powered off the system for
safety to both the user and the system), turn the plastic handles (later
800's had screws with washers) and lift off the top cover of the Atari
800.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you had access for 4 expansion slots.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Slot #0 was for the Operating System ROM board, Slots #1 to #3 were for
memory modules.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Slot #3 was also used for 80 column video
cards).&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply insert the memory module into the next free
slot and place the cover back onto the case, secure the latches or screws,
close the cartridge door and you were all set, no configuration software
to run, no jumpers to set.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks more like Atari invented
"Plug N Play" then Microsoft :)</FONT>
