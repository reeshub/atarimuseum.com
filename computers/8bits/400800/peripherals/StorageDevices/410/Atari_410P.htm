					<td><font face="Arial" size="4">The Atari 410 was the 
					initial version of the Atari 410 Program Recorder (tape 
					drive.)&nbsp; Released at the debut of the Atari 400/800 
					computers in 1979. This version was sold from 1979 through 
					part of 1980 and replaced with the Atari 410a. Functionally 
					they are both identical.&nbsp; The 410a version omits the 
					carrying handle and is more ruggedly built.</font><p>
					<font face="Arial" size="4">Tape drives were very popular 
					with home computer systems through the 1970's through the 
					1980's.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many home computers had audio jack 
					interfaces on them so off the shelf tape cassette players 
					could be plugged into them.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Tape cassettes were a widely 
					used magnetic media that was used for playing music through 
					the 1970's into the late 1980's until it was replaced with 
					more durable music CD's.&nbsp; Because they were so widely 
					used, they were easily accessible to everyone and they were 
					low cost and easy to use.&nbsp; That made them a perfect 
					choice for use in home computers to store and load programs 
					from.&nbsp; The benefit of this was low cost and easy 
					accessibility.&nbsp; The downside was they were very slow to 
					save and load programs to and from and they were more prone 
					to data corruption.</font></p>
					<div>
						<font face="Arial" size="4">Unlike most other tape 
						drives used on other computers, the ATARI 410 Program 
						Recorder is a special peripheral. It uses the Atari SIO 
						serial bus to send and receive data, but does not 
						conform to the protocol of the other peripherals that 
						use the SIO serial bus. The Program Recorder must also 
						be the last device on the serial bus, because it does 
						not have a serial bus extender connector as the other 
						peripherals do. There can never be more than one Program 
						Recorder connected to any system for the same reason. 
						The system cannot sense the presence or absence of the 
						Program Recorder so it can be connected and disconnected 
						at will.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="4">Atari 410 
						Program Records had a unique double-track feature, 
						enabling sound and data to be recorded and transmitted. 
						This was used in such programs as the Atari Foreign 
						Language Modules, and the Invitation to Programming 
						series, utilizing a narrator while the program ran on 
						screen. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial" size="4">The Atari 410 used the 
						advanced Serial I/O interface (SIO), enabling easy 
						connection to the computer. Originally designed 
						specifically for the 410, it was decided to use it on 
						all Atari 8-Bit peripherals. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial" size="4">The Atari Program 
						Recorders provide storage and retrieval of programs and 
						data on cassette tape. In addition to the digital track 
						that stores computer data, a second audio track is 
						provided to play music or voice as the program runs.</font></p>
						<p>&nbsp;</div>
					<div>
						<font face="Arial" size="4">Data transmission rate: 600 
						bits per second.<br>
						Data storage capacity: 100,000 bytes per 60-minute 
						cassette.<br>
						Track configuration: 4 track, 2 channel (digital data 
						and audio track)<br>
						Built-in SIO cable - must end SIO daisy chain<br>
						Built-in power cable - plugs directly into wall<br>
