&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While many users were moving
to XL's and XE's to obtain more memory by using such memory upgrades as
the Newell memory upgrades or using other various products.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari 800 owners were feeling a little less then adequate with their memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The only really large memory upgrade at the time was the Alxon Mosaic memory
cards allow up to 192K in your Atari 800.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well a company from
New York called Maga Systems began selling a memory upgrade card.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This card acted as a normal 16K memory card and had to be seated in slot
#2, some minor jumper wire modifications had to be done on the underside
of the Atari 800 motherboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; When run with with a modified
version of Atari DOS, the Magna 256K would initialize and provide a 240K
RAMdisk which was extremely useful, especially to BBS SysOps who needed
extra speed for disk access without a hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Magna systems
also had a 1MB memory card available as well.
