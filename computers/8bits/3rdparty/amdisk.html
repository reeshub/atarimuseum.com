Amdek was better known for its high quality monochrome and color composite
monitors which were used by almost every computer user back in the 1970's
and 1980's.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1983 Amdek began to sell a new line of 3 1/4"
hard shelled diskette drives for the Atari 8-bit line of computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They came packaged with OSS DOS XL.</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They system came with two 360K disk drive mechanisms and on the rear of
the drive box was a built in power supply, cooling fan for the power and
drives as well as 2 SIO connectors to allow diasy chaining of additional
peripherals as well as an Atari 850 compatible printer interface and a
slave-drive connector to add on 2 additional drives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although an expensive option at the time the Amdisk system was well worth
it because it packed so much storage and features into one clean simple
box.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amdek's 3 1/4" design did not become a standard
but instead was superseeded by the 3 1/2" micro floppy standard used worldwide
today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari, Inc had plans
of its own to sell a 3 1/2" disk drive called the Atari 1055, it was developed
at Atari's northern California lab in conjunction with Seagate/Shugart.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The disk drive was never sold, several pilot run units exist.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari, Corp had developed
the XF351 disk drive which was a 3 1/2" disk drive for the XE line of Atari
8-bit computers, this too only made it into the pilot run stage and was
never sold to the public, instead Atari Corp released the XF551 5 1/4"
disk drive for the XE's to replace the Atari 1050 disk drive.</font>
