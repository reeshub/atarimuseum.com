The ATR8000 was a truly amazing addition to any Atari owners computer system.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Literally it was all that you would ever need.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ATR8000
provided any Atari 8-bit computer with a high speed serial interface, parallel
printer interface with 64K printer buffer and a standard IBM type floppy
disk controller which allowed you to hook up 5.25" disk drives of any size,
8" disk drives and even 3.5" disk drives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another wonderful
feature of the ATR8000 was its ability to use an Atari computer as a terminal
which would communicate with the ATR8000 while it ran in CP/M mode so you
suddenly had access to thousands of programs like WordStar 2000 which at
the time was a fantastic word processor and many, many other application
packages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the addition of a CO-Power-88 add-on card,
you now had limited IBM PC compatibility which gave your Atari computer
even more power and access to applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ATR8000
was a self-contained system and didn't require the need for an actual Atari
computer, but could run from a standard serial terminal as a stand alone
CP/M system. Atari itself began to take an interest in the growing CP/M
software market and had planned on released an ADD-ON peripheral called
the Atari 1060 CP/M box and also planned on selling a CP/M expansion card
for its <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/1090xl.html">1090: XL Expansion
System</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; However neither one of these products made it to
market.</font>
