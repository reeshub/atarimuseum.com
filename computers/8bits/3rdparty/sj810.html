<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In California,
the home of Atari in its many offices in the state, many Atari dealers
sprang up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today only a tiny handful of dealers
remain such as <A HREF="http://www.myatari.com">B&amp;C Computervisions
Atari Sales &amp; Service Center</A> (916-295-9270) and BEST Electronics
(408-243-6950).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well another company that used to be
a mainstream Atari computer dealer was called San Jose Computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Apparently the owner who had purchased large quantities of excess Atari
400 and 800 motherboards, power supplies, RAM cards and so forth also purchased
a large quantity of Atari 810 mechanisms and boards as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So he had some custom all aluminum cases designed to fit the Atari 810
drives into and sold these special edition Atari 810 disk drives as you
see in the above picture.</FONT>
