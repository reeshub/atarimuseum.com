&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every computer users dream was
to be able to have to enormous and powerful hard drive system.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the early 80's a 10MB hard drive system was something that made computer
users heads spin with glee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add to this the fact that
with up to 8 multiplexers with 8 ports each they could connect up to 64
Atari 800's up to a single 10 or even 20 megabyte Atari system, well you
can imagine how incredible that would have sounded back then.&nbsp; (<B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still in use Today at the Fordham Prepatory School in the Bronx, NY is
a 64 Atari 800 computer network hooked up to a single Corvus Hard drive
system!)

<P><IMG SRC="CORVUS-1.JPG" HEIGHT=198 WIDTH=320 ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp; The Corvus
Hard Drive system exploited a little used ability of the powerful interface
ports on the Atari 800 computer system.&nbsp;&nbsp; While almost everyone
else was using the interface ports for plugging joysticks into and playing
games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corvus Systems used a very simple interface using
about a dozen gate-chips to communicate with the PIA interface through
joystick ports 3&amp;4 of the Atari 800.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a specially
modified version of Atari DOS 2.0d (most users only had access to DOS 2.0s)
or using an OS replacement board by David Small (Creator of MagicSac Mac
emulator for the Atari ST's) called "The Integrator" an Atari 800 computer
could access and use the Corvus hard drive as 8 DS/DD disk drives.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If "The Integrator" was used, the OS board could be set to boot off of
the Corvus hard drive and no 810 disk drive would be necessary.

<P>The Corvus hard disk system also sported a unique and innovative back-up
system called "The Corvus Mirror" which was a VCR interface system that
allowed you to plug a standard Video Cassette Recorder (VCR) up to the
Corvus Hard Drive System to save back-ups of the hard disk onto actual
Video Tapes!!!

<HR WIDTH="100%">Note:&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari listed a Corvus interface as one
of the many proposed future interface cards it had planned for its <A HREF="1090xl.html">Atari
1090: XL Expansion System</A>, so Corvus was obviously a noticed an important
company to Atari if they had planned to support the hard drive with its
future XL products.&nbsp;&nbsp; However since Atari never got the 1090XL
out to market and soon after was sold to the Trameils, Corvus discontinued
the Atari 800 interface and all support of the Atari systems.</CENTER>
