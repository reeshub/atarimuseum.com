&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This OS card was a "Must Have"
for any Atari computer user who had a <A HREF="corvus.html">Corvus Hard
Disk System</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; It allowed the use of the Corvus with DOS'
other than Atari's own Corvus modified DOS 2.0d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also you could
set the OS board so that it would boot directly from the Corvus hard disk
without the need for a floppy drive such as an Atari 810 connected to the
system.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was excellent for environments which large numbers
of Atari 800's using MUX's to connect to a single Corvus hard disk without
having to supply a floppy disk drive for each system.
