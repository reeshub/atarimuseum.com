&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While
many people never saw or heard of this device, it was exceptionally useful
for classroom situations.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've only seen one school that ever
used it and it was right here on Staten Island, New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The network consisted of 4 Atari 800's, 1 Atari 810 and 1 Axiom Dot Matrix
Printer.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Network 216 and Monitor 16 were made by a company called Wolsten's Computer
Devices, Inc. which was in East Orange, New Jersey.&nbsp;&nbsp; The company
has long since disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The network worked
as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; scanned all active Atari computers and requestion
and action, it automatically skipped unused computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to
16 computers could be fully booted with a standard Atari 810 disk drive
in under 3 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the Monitor 16, two way individual
communication between the Master station and one of up to 16 computers
could be done.&nbsp;&nbsp; Master station could visually monitor each individual
computer screen and communicate privately via headphones to the user for
assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The original price for the Network 216 &amp;
Monitor 16 package was $1995.00, just the Network 216 was $1695.00, later
on they introduced a smaller Network 24 which had one 4 network connection
available to share up to 4 disk drives and 1 printer.
