The Atari XF551 was Atari's last disk drive manufactured for the Atari
400/800, XL/XE line of Personal Computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drive
was compatible with all previous Atari formats back to the original Atari
810 disk drive 88K single sided/single density format.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The drive could be set to drive #'s 1-4 by configuration the dip switchs
on the back of the unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drive was shipped with Atari
DOS 2.5 which became of the defacto standard DOS' used by the majority
of the Atari community.&nbsp;&nbsp; However Atari later on would release
Atari DOS XE which truly unleashed the Atari XF551 capabilities, speed
and full storage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari DOS XE allowed for subdirectories,
scripting and many other powerful features only found in such 3rd Party
products as ICD SpartaDOS and MS-DOS on the PC Platforms.</font>
