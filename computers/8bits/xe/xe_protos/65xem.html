					Atari 65XEM Personal Computer System.&nbsp;This unreleased 
					computer was a standard Atari 65XE computer fitted with a 
					special&nbsp; Audio Processor called &quot;AMY&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shown at the 1985 
					CES, the 65XEM was touted as having remarkable capabilities 
					for sound/voice synthesis.</font> </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font color="#000000">
					<font size="+1" face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The AMY Sound 
					Processor was originally a chip designed for newer high end 
					computer systems in 1983 in the Advanced Engineering 
					Division (also referred to as the Atari Corporate Research 
					Lab) in Sunnyvale, CA.&nbsp;&nbsp;AMY was part of a new chipset called 
					&quot;<b><a href="../../../aed/RAINBOW">Rainbow</a></b>.&quot; The 
					graphics portion of the chipset consisted of two chips 
					called Silver and Gold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together these chips created a 
					formidable computer system capable of graphics and sound 
					rivaling many computers which came out years later.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					Unfortunately these computers would never see the light of 
					day due to the sale of Atari in 1984.</font> </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font color="#000000">
					<font size="+1" face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;AMY was demonstrated 
					in 1983 performing a demonstration of a Female Opera singer, 
					then on the fly was instructed to perform the same opera in 
					a Male voice.</font> <br>

					&nbsp;Seeing the</font><font color="#000000"><font size="+1" face="Arial,Helvetica"> 
					potential of this new audio chip, Atari's chief engineer - 
					Shiraz Shivji intended to implement it into the new &quot;RBP&quot; 
					projrect.&nbsp; &quot;RBP&quot; was the acronym for &quot;Rock Bottom Price&quot; and 
					was to be a new high end 16 bit computer system that would 
					rival the Apple Macintosh but would cost under $1,000 for a 
					color version of the system.&nbsp; With a very demanding deadline 
					schedule to have a working demonstration system readied in 
					only 5 months after the purchase of Atari by the Tramiels, 
					the AMY processor's viability was in doubt so it was quickly 
					removed from the Atari ST specifications and replaced with a 
					Yamaha sound processor.&nbsp; The AMY chip was then slated for 
					use in the 65XE series computer which was a direct 
					replacement for the Atari 800XL computer.&nbsp; </font><br>

					1983 was Jack Palevich (who earlier had wrote a game called 
					Dandy as part of the APX (Atari Program Exchange, a division 
					of Atari that published high quality software from 
					independent programmer), which was an amazing D&amp;D type game 
					that Atari would later base its Atari Gauntlet franchise 
					on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John also did Atari Dark Chambers which was another 
					Dandy variant for the Atari home consoles ) and some of his 
					original software still exists on some demonstration and 
					development disks that came with this 65XEM prototype.&nbsp;</font></p>
