Note:&nbsp; Atari XE Systems</font></font>

On July 2, 1984 Atari, Inc was sold to Jack Tramiel (former head of Commodore)
who renamed the company Atari Corporation.&nbsp; All Atari XL home computer
system projects were canceled including the Atari 1400XL and 1450XLD computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A new line of Atari home computers were promised with updates to the aging
8-bit line of computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; These new computers were designated
numbers to represent their memory configuration such as the 130XE had 130,000
bytes of memory and the XE stood for <b><font color="#FF0000">XL</font></b>
line <b><font color="#FF0000">E</font><font color="#FFFFFF">xtended</font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
These new systems, the Atari 65XE and 130XE would include the FREDDIE Memory
Management chip originally designed for the Atari XL series computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Originally no expansion capabilities were going to be included, but after
a loud out-cry from Atari Computer User Groups Atari caved in and included
a "revised" version of the PBI (Parallel Bus Interface) connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The new connector was called the ECI for "Extended Cartridge Interface"
which was a repackaged version of the PBI to cut costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the winter 1985 CES in Las Vegas Atari displayed the new 65XE and 130XE
systems as well as several other types of XE systems such as the never
released&nbsp; 65 XEP (the "P" standing for Portable) which was a small
"luggable" computer with built in 5" Black &amp; Green screen, built in
disk drive and detachable keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also displayed was the
65XEM (the "M" standing for Music, the 65XEM was to have the "AMY" sound
chip.&nbsp; Problems plagued the 65XEM project and it never came to market.)</font></font>

Essentially the XE were nothing more then Atari 800XL's in new grey clothing
and no real improvement over the XL series.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new keyboards
had a soft mushy feel and the keys were white and tended to get dirty quickly,
and the function keys were on a 45 degree angle making them clumsy to use
at times, the US 65XE's lacked an ECI all together, although the 800XE
which was Europe's 65XE counterpart did include an ECI port.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although
sold as a GAME SYSTEM, the Atari XEGS (released in 1987) was a repackaged
Atari 65XE with Missle Command built in.&nbsp; However the one nice feature
of the system was the detachable keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the exception
of the unreleased Atari 65XE-P Portable (Luggable) computer, the Atari
XEGS was the only Atari 8-Bit computer system to ever have a detachable
keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its console base unfortunately could not accomodate
a monitor being placed on top it which would have been a nice feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It would have been nice if Atari had made one last version of the XE in
the Mega ST case, however this never came to pass.</font></font>
