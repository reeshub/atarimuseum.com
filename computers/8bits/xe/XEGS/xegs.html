		<p><font size="4" face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000">&nbsp;In 1987 
		Atari Corp released the new Atari XEGS (XE Game System).&nbsp;</font> </p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left">
			<font size="4" face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000">&nbsp;The system 
			was basically a repackaged Atari 65XE computer.&nbsp; With No ECI 
			(Extended Cartridge Interface) peripherals such hard drives and 
			other ECI/PBI devices could not be used.&nbsp;When the Keyboard (the 
			first and only released detachable keyboard for the 8-bit line of 
			computers) was not attached the system would come up with Missile 
			Command which was built-in.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the keyboard was attached the 
			system would come up with Atari BASIC and acted just like a standard 
			Atari 65XE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> </p>
			<p align="left">
			<font size="4" face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000">The system was 
			packaged with the Console, an Atari CX-40 joystick, a Light gun and 
			several game cartridges.&nbsp;&nbsp; The system originally sold for $199 and 
			the buyer received a game system which was a computer and came 
			packaged with numerous software titles on Cartridges.&nbsp;Nintendo sued 
			Atari over advertising which stated that the Atari XEGS had the most 
			games for any game system.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawsuit involved what Nintendo 
			claimed was false advertising by Atari, which at the time, did not 
			currently sell a disk drive for the 8-bit line of computers (Atari 
			was simply selling its remaining stock of Atari 1050 disk drives, 
			but they were not manufacturing any new disk drives at the time).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
			</p>
			<p align="left">
			<font size="4" face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000">Atari quickly 
			produced and released the Atari XF551 disk drive which was a 360K 
			5.25&quot; floppy drive system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although packaged as a game console, 
			the Atari XEGS is more computer then game system and is classified 
			as a computer here at the Atari Museum.</font></p>
