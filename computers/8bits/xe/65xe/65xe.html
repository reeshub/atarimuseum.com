						<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">&nbsp;Introduced 
						at the 1985 CES in Las Vegas.The Atari 65XE was part of 
						a cost reduction plan and would be the replacement for 
						the Atari 800XLF Personal Computer introduced in August 
						of 1984.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Price at $99.99 the 65XE was 100% compatible 
						with all of the Atari 400/800, and XL software (some 
						programs required the use of a &quot;Translator&quot; disk before 
						use) and all peripherals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 65XE computer had 64K 
						of memory like the Atari 800XL and all of the same 
						custom chips as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;The XE series computers would 
						also use the&nbsp; FREDDIE chip from the 800XLF 
						(originally used in the Atari 1400XL and 1450XLD 
						computers.)&nbsp;&nbsp; This was memory address multiplexing chip.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						When combined with the Atari </font><font face="Arial">
						C061618</font><font face="Arial" color="#000000"> MMU 
						chip (Memory Management Unit)&nbsp; the system could 
						handle memory swapping and larger amounts of memory more 
						efficiently, but most important was that the ANTIC could 
						now independently access memory and not have to share it 
						with the CPU. <br>

						<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The 65XE would come 
						in a low cost, 2 piece utilitarian gray case.&nbsp; The 
						more expensive and more stylish XL case designs were 
						abandoned</font><font face="Arial" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
						Atari 65XE while having the advantage FREDDIE and MMU 
						chips had a major shortcoming over the Atari 800XLF 
						which it had replaced.&nbsp;&nbsp; The US versions did NOT have an 
						external expansion bus (the Atari XL computers had a PBI 
						connector (Parallel Bus Interface) while the European 
						Atari 65XE's (also called Atari 800XE's) and Atari 
						130XE's (both US and European) all had an ECI (Enhanced 
						Cartridge Interface) which was functionally equivalent 
						to the previous Atari XL PBI and allowed devices such as 
						SCSI hard drive controllers, parallel/serial controllers 
						and many other powerful devices to be attached to the XE 
						system.&nbsp;&nbsp; While Atari itself never sold any ECI devices, 
						several 3rd Party companies such an ICD, CSS and Supra 
						sold expansion peripherals for use with the ECI/PBI 
						ports. <br>

						<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">With 
						only a tiny time frame to work within from July 1984 
						until January 1985 Atari engineers took the existing 
						Atari 800XL design as well as the 800XLF design and 
						created new PCB's to fit into their lower cost cases 
						with lower cost keyboards. The 2 piece cases greatly 
						reduced the cost of the product, though their design was 
						rather drab and unappealing compared to the more 
						stylish, yet more expensive XL case designs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						The keyboards were another shortcoming of the design.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						They were mushy and lacked solid tactile rebound to them 
						and this was a major complaint for many users.</font></p>

						Early runs of the 65XE had motherboards still retained 
						the products original model number: the Atari 900XLF.&nbsp;&nbsp;
