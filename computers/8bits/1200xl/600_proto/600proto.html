    Story of the &quot;Other 600&quot;... &nbsp; This was NOT the prototype of what was to be 
    the Atari 600XL.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact the Atari 600 prototype shown on this page is 
    actually where the Atari 1200XL had come from.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is LIZ-NY.&nbsp;&nbsp; Designed 
    in the WCI/NY Atari labs run by Steve Mayer, who was one of the founders of 
    Atari's think-tank called Cyan Engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyan is the birthplace of the 
    Atari VCS (2600) and the Atari Home Computers.&nbsp; LIZ was meant to be a low 
    cost Atari computer, but with an interesting twist... it would be able to 
    run slightly modified Atari VCS game code.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a vision that Steve 
    Mayer had always had since the original Atari computers were being designed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">&nbsp;</font><font size="4" face="Arial">The basic concept of a 
    low cost, single board replacement computer for the Atari 800 would be 
    brought into the labs in Sunnyvale and the Atari 1200XL would be created.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    However, the 50 pin high-speed expansion bus of the LIZ-NY computer would be 
    dropped mid-course during the Atari 1200XL development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marketing would 
    take especially strong interest in a new device being designed along side of 
    the new Atari 1200XL computer called at the time the &quot;Modem Interface 
    Module&quot; -- this device would eventually evolved into the Atari 1030 modem.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Seeing that devices like this could load their own drivers and even software 
    into the home computer, marketing decided that ALL devices should would like 
    that, so they had the expansion connector and a future external expansion 
    box canceled and the original design of the 1200XL would be canceled and the 
    closed box &quot;Toaster&quot; design of the 1200XL would be the result.</font><br>

  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; <font size="4">By mid March of 1983 Atari 
    would already begin work on a lower cost companion to the 1200XL.&nbsp; If anyone 
    ever wondered, why when the 1200XL was canceled and replaced with the 800XL, 
    why wasn't its lower end companion called the 400XL.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the lower 
    cost companion was started before the 800XL and it was a lower cost 
    companion to the 1200XL and hence became known as the 600XL.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By June of 
    1983 the assembly lines for the 1200XL would be shut down and sent to Tawain, 
    remaining parts and supplies for leftover 1200XL's would be assembled in 
    Taiwan until those supplies were used up in July 1983.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile in June 
    1983 the 800XL was already well in the works and then the beginnings of two 
    higher end systems are spec'd - called the 1400XL and 1450XLzD.</font></font></p>
