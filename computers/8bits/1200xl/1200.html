The Atari 1200 and the finally Atari 1200XL have no real differences accept
in the label and the casing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The label lacks the XL (e<b>X</b>tended
<b>L</b>ine) designation and the case is a smooth finish instead of the
rough finish on the sold versions of the XL's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only
other interesting note is the fact that this system was modified, whether
it was done in-house by Atari or done by someone outside of Atari along
the lines of the Brent Borghese 1200XL OS modification are unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However this Atari 1200 has Atari 800 OS ROM's contained within it instead
of the Atari 1200XL ROM's, also the 800 piggybacked ROM's have a handwritten
neon green label stating 11/16/82 on them.</font>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial">For many years I have been tracking
down the elusive &quot;vapor&quot; trail of what was the earlier Atari 1200
design (sometimes referred to as the Atari Z800, then as the Sweet-16 and also
as the Atari 1000 and 1000X line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally during some research
on the Atari 1400XL for a friend and fellow Atari enthusiast I stumbled upon a
lost treasure trove of materials pertaining to the very early designs of the
Atari 1200XL.</font><p><font face="Arial">I have spoken with numerous Atari
engineers, Dave Sovey in particular had informed me of a side by side
&quot;Sister Project&quot; of the 1200XL and that there were actually two
versions in development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several years later
Dave's information had been verified when I found a copy of the Atari Sweet-16
Spec's, it was a very early document discussing an Atari 1200XL which much more
expansion and capabilities then what eventually came onto dealer shelves in
1982.</font><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8BITS/1200xl/s-16/s-16-proto_schedule.jpg" width="600" height="450"><p align="left"><font face="Arial">The
Atari prototypes came with an &quot;X&quot; designation, followed by a revision
# and then followed by an A designation (whether A stood for Atari or for an
Alpha version is unclear).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown in the above
Revision Schedule, designs started in 3/26/82 and went into 5/13/82.&nbsp;&nbsp;
What's not shown is the date for revision X8A which was from other documents in
early July 1982.</font><p align="left">&nbsp;<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8BITS/1200xl/s-16/s-16-proto_production_plot-RevX10A-Elizabeth.jpg" width="640" height="480"><p align="left"><font face="Arial">Interestingly
enough, this above photo plot also from July 82 shows revision X10A which was
nearly identical to what becomes the production Atari 1200XL
motherboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of unusual note is the project
appears to have not one, but TWO codenames, apparently this is where the
original S-16 (Sweet-16) project takes a fork in its design, rev X8A also says
Elizabeth on it, but in a different location...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far there
is no revision X9A, it skips from X8A to X10A and then to final production.</font><p align="left">&nbsp;<p align="center"><a href="http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8BITS/1200xl/s-16/s-16-proto_PCB_RevX8A.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8BITS/1200xl/s-16/s-16-proto_PCB_RevX8A-small.jpg"></a><p align="left"><font face="Arial">This
is the actual PCB layout of the revision X8A PCB for the Atari
&quot;Sweet-16&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where things get
interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the above image to examine it more
closely...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the layout is entirely different from the
production 1200XL computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take particular note of the
upper right corner of this PCB design - there is a 50 Pin header footprint and
the traces all lead to the major IC's on the board which means this was the very
first PBI (Parallel Bus Interface) which appears to have been meant as an
internal device interface versus the later XL designs which brought the PBI
directly out of the system to an Edge Connector.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial">Next
thing to note is the Upper Center edge of the PCB, note the 2 DB-15 footprints
versus an Atari SIO footprint.&nbsp;&nbsp; This directly correlates with the
early Atari Sweet-16 spec's document detailing the inclusion of 2 15 pin
connectors to replace the original SIO and would allow for peripherals to
automatically power up when the system powered up.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial">The
departure from the X1A-X8A design to suddenly a radically different X10A design
that appears at the same timeframe in July 1982 means that there must've been a
side by side &quot;Sister Project&quot; of the Atari 1000 series being built and
it moved into place to become the production machine leading to a disaster
product launch for a system with plenty of sexy looks, but nothing under the
hood, so to speak.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial">I am currently
investigating the possibility of having a PCB design firm that still works with
physical Padmaster films to reproduce actual samples of the X8A revision
motherboard, the real &quot;Sweet-16&quot; computer system to allow for further
study and examination.</font><p align="left">&nbsp;<p align="left">&nbsp;<p align="left">&nbsp;
