        <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">For many years the Atari Museum has 
        been tracking down the elusive &quot;vapor&quot; trail of what was the earlier 
        Atari 1200 design (sometimes referred to as the Atari Z800, then as the 
        Sweet-16 and also as the Atari 1000 and 1000X line.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally during 
        some research on the Atari 1400XL for a friend and fellow Atari 
        enthusiast, information was stumbled upon... a lost treasure trove of 
        materials pertaining to the very early designs of the Atari 1200XL 
        called &quot;Elizabeth&quot;.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Speaking with numerous Atari 
        engineers, Dave Sovey in particular had informed the Atari Museum of a 
        side by side &quot;Sister Project&quot; of the 1200XL and that there were actually 
        two versions in development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several years later Dave's information 
        had been verified when the Atari Museum found a copy of the Atari 
        Sweet-16 Spec's, it was a very early document discussing an Atari 1200XL 
        with much more expansion and capabilities then what eventually came onto 
        dealer shelves in 1983.</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Atari prototypes came with an &quot;X&quot; 
        designation, followed by a revision # and then followed by an A 
        designation (whether A stood for Atari or for an Alpha version is 
        unclear).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown in the above Revision Schedule, designs started 
        in 3/26/82 and went into 5/13/82.&nbsp;&nbsp; What's not shown is the date for 
        revision X8A which was from other documents in early July 1982.&nbsp; Another 
        interesting note:&nbsp; No Revision X7A, despite there being a full set of 
        board layout drawings and schematics for it.</font></p>

        identical to what becomes the production Atari 1200XL motherboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of 
        unusual note is the project appears to have not one, but TWO codenames, 
        apparently this is where the original S-16 (Sweet-16) project takes a 
        fork in its design, rev X8A also says Elizabeth on it, but in a 
        different location...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far there is no revision X9A, it skips from 
        X8A to X10A and then to final production.</font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This is the actual PCB layout of the 
        revision X8A PCB for the Atari &quot;Sweet-16&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where things get 
        interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the above image to examine it more 
        closely...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the layout is entirely different from the 
        production 1200XL computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take particular note of the upper right 
        corner of this PCB design - there is a 50 Pin header footprint and the 
        traces all lead to the major IC's on the board which means this was the 
        very first PBI (Parallel Bus Interface) which appears to have been meant 
        as an internal device interface versus the later XL designs which 
        brought the PBI directly out of the system to an Edge Connector.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Next thing to note is the Upper 
        Center edge of the PCB, note the 2 DB-15 footprints versus an Atari SIO 
        footprint.&nbsp;&nbsp; This directly correlates with the early Atari Sweet-16 
        spec's document detailing the inclusion of 2 15 pin connectors to 
        replace the original SIO and would allow for peripherals to 
        automatically power up when the system powered up.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The departure from the X1A-X8A design 
        to suddenly a radically different X10A design that appears at the same 
        timeframe in July 1982 means that there must've been a side by side 
        &quot;Sister Project&quot; of the Atari 1000 series being built and it moved into 
        place to become the production machine leading to a disaster product 
        launch for a system with plenty of sexy looks, but nothing under the 
        hood, so to speak.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b><i>***Final Thoughts***</i></b></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Several things we have to take away 
		from the original 1200XL with the expansion header are this:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Every revision of the new 1200XL 
			OS - Revision 10 (which was the replacement for the Atari 400/800 OS 
			Revision B, never had any support for handling Parallel Devices.&nbsp; 
			Revision 11, which came out in the last several months of the Atari 
			1200XL production run (Jan 1983 to end of June 1983) also had no 
			support for Parallel device handling.</font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial">We would have to assume the 
			Expansion header was just buss line connections with no intelligent 
			management of any devices connected to it.&nbsp; So this could end 
			up limiting its expansion capabilities similar to how the 800 even 
			it if had more than one &quot;Slot 3&quot; would've had difficulty handling 
			more than one expansion device board.</font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Atari's RF/EMI engineer noted 
			that the X8A and earlier was very noisy.&nbsp; So this too could 
			lend to why the header is removed from the design.&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The 1200XL may have simply been a 
			stop-gap release product and then 3 months after its release the 
			more formalized designs of the &quot;Surely&quot; - the 600XL and the 
			replacement for the 1200XL - the &quot;Surley Plus&quot; - the 800XL would now 
			have all of the Parallel Device support and the design for an 
			external Expansion System is also created.</font></p></li>
		</ul>
		<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Atari Museum is currently 
        investigating the possibility of having a PCB design firm that still 
        works with physical Padmaster films to reproduce actual samples of the 
        X8A revision motherboard, the real &quot;Sweet-16&quot; computer system to allow 
        for further study and examination.</font></p>
