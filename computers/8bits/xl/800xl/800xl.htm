          <blockquote>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Atari 800XL was the 
            third version of the Atari XL 8-bit line of computers introduced in 
            1983.&nbsp; It specifications were completed in late March 1983. The 
            system contained a full 64K of memory, had all the standard Atari 
            chips (Antic, GTIA, Pokey, PIA) and was in a smaller and more 
            compact design than the 1200XL which it was designed to replace. The 
            keyboard was good, but not nearly as good as the 1200XL keyboard, 
            but it had a solid feel to it. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The cartridge port had 
            been move to the top center of the system in the same fashion as the 
            600XL and used special metal spring loaded doors to allow the 
            insertion and removal of ROM cartridges.&nbsp;This system of spring 
            loaded doors also kept dirt and objects from falling into the 
            cartridge slot when it was not occupied. Overall the system is 
            basically a cost reduced Atari 1200XL, but with a better video 
            display, expansion bus and a much lower retail price.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The system, just like 
            the 1200XL also came with built-in diagnostics and a HELP key, 
            however it provided one important improvement: Built in BASIC. The 
            OS was still slightly incompatible with many original Atari 400/800 
            software titles, but Atari began to distribute a &quot;Translator&quot; disk 
            which would load up a 400/800 compatible OS into memory so that the 
            800XL could support those programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A newer version of the 
            800XL was being readied called the 800XLF which included the new 
            &quot;FREDDIE&quot; chip that would have allowed for more use of free memory 
            for programs and greater use of graphics by the &quot;ANTIC&quot; DMA/Display 
            List processor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally the new 800XL with FREDDIE 
			and the new CGIA (Antic and GTIA combined chip)&nbsp; was 
			designed and readied in June of 1983.</font><br>

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Atari BASIC programming 
    language could be disabled by holding down the OPTION key on boot-up. The 
    other new feature of the 800XL was the new high speed Parallel Bus Interface 
    (PBI) which would allow the 800XL to connect to the Atari 1090: XL Expansion 
    System which was an expansion box with 5 slots in it for an assortment of 
    expansion cards.</font> <br>

Reducing the 800XL line of computers, a newer version called the Atari 800XLCR 
(Codenamed &quot;Keri&quot;) was already in the works and the new chip: &quot;KERI&quot; which was 
the Combined GTIA, ANTIC and POKEY was in tests and almost
