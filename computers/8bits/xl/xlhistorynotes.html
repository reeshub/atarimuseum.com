<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari XL series of computers
which quickly replaced the Atari 1200XL initially consisted of the Atari
600XL and 800XL were released in 1983.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other systems
were slated for release in early 1984 which were the Atari 1400XL and Atari
1450XLD.&nbsp;&nbsp; However the Atari 1400XL would never see the light
of day.&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been slated to be cancelled within the company
and finished for research purposes only.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 1450XLD
was supposed to be released around the summer to fall of 1984 and it too
would never been released because of the sale of Atari, inc. to the Tramiel
family.&nbsp;&nbsp; The entire XL line of computers were cancelled to be
replaced by the XE line of computers instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other XL systems
were mentioned but in one way or another never made it past the drawing
boards and wirewrapping stages.&nbsp; The Atari 1650XLD was rumored to
be an MS-DOS clone system in an Atari 1450XLD case, also an Atari 800XLD
was talked about but never produced (it would have been an 800XL with "Freddie"
MMU and disk drive in an Atari 1450XLD case) and the final XL was to be
the Atari 1850XL which was to be the Atari version of the licensed Amiga
technology.&nbsp;&nbsp; (In September of 1983 Atari and Amiga signed into
a contractual agreement that Atari would fund Amiga $500,000 to complete
the development of the Amiga chipset.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari would get exclusive
rights to use the chipset under the Atari name for a new high-end game
console.&nbsp;&nbsp; After one year, Atari could then sell a keyboard upgrade
for the game console, plus utilitize the technology in a new series of
Atari computer systems.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 30, 1984 Amiga was set
to deliver the chipset to Atari but backed out, instead it had negotiated
with Commodore to repay the loan back to Atari that Amiga had borrowed
to develop the Amiga chipset and Commodore bought Amiga.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari
was never able to produce both its 1850XL computer and also its new high-end
video game console which were both to be based on the Amiga chipset technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On August 13, 1984 Atari filed suit against Amiga for breach of contract
and use of technology that Atari had paid to be developed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The suit was settled in 1987, however it was a closed decision and although
rumors leaked that Atari won the suit, no positive confirmation of this
has been found to date.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The electronics design
of the Atari XL series of computers were done in the New York WCI Atari
research labs under Steve Mayer with Gregg Squires as the head of Engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile in Atari's Sunnyvale offices in the Industrial Design group headed
by Roy Nishi, Regan Cheng designed the all new look for Atari's second
generation of computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Going for a very attractive high-tech
look based on similarities to equipment made by Bang &amp; Olufsen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Regan Cheng designed an all-new look into what became the first Atari XL
computer, the Atari 1200XL.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can probably be labelled
the world's first stylish and sexy looking computer system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The XL series of off-white/dark brown, low profile, high tech looking systems
was born.</font>
