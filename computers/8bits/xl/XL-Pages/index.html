					<i><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The History of the Atari 
					XL Computer Systems</font></b></i></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial">In 1981 Atari began work on its 
					replacement to the Atari 400/800 computer systems in an 
					effort to keep them current with technologies, give them an 
					updated and more modern look and to reduce cost of 
					manufacture.</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial">The first design went through numerous 
					project codenames:&nbsp; Z800, Sweet-16 and Elizabeth.&nbsp; 
					Eventually it would be officially called the Atari 1200 then 
					upon its release in January 1983 it would be officially 
					called the 1200XL. The new Atari XL series was born.</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial">The Atari 1200XL originally would have a 
					simple Buss expander and 2 new 15 pin SIO connectors.&nbsp; 
					Issues with RF noise, wanting a more formalized and capable 
					expansion design and marketing not firm on how to move 
					forward with the series having different designed SIO 
					connectors, the 1200XL would be scaled back to a more closed 
					design while Atari's engineering group would formalize its 
					new &quot;PBI&quot; Parallel Bus Interface design and create a new OS 
					to intelligently manage external parallel devices.</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial">The 1200XL would start to arrive into 
					dealers by February 1983 and in March of 1983 the 
					specifications for the 600XL and 800XL computers would be 
					completed. The 600XL would be the replacement to the Atari 
					400 as the 1200XL was the replacement to the Atari 800.&nbsp; 
					The 800XL would be the replacement for the 1200XL since the 
					1200XL would not be able to fit with the newer XL's and also 
					since the original replacement for the 1200XL, called the 
					1201XL was changed to have a built in modem and voice 
					synthesizer and would become the Atari 1400XL which was 
					spec'd out along with the 1250XLD in June of 1983.</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The 1250XLD would change to 
					become the 1450XLD, this would have a modem, voice 
					synthesizer and a built in parallel disk drive interface 
					with support for up to 2 360K high speed disk drives.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					All 4 of the new XL systems were expected to be ready for 
					sale by the fall of 1983.&nbsp; Atari's CEO, Ray Kassar 
					would be fired due to stock market insider trading and a 
					loss of confidence by Warner Communications CEO Steve Ross 
					in June of 1983.&nbsp; A new CEO for Atari was hired but he 
					wouldn't start until September and when he did, he cam e 
					into the company, put a 30 day hold of all work and canceled 
					all projects he felt would not benefit Atari.&nbsp; </font>
					</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The 1400XL and 1450XLD were 
					called, along with the Atari 1060 CP/M box, the Atari 1600XL 
					hybrid Atari/MS-DOS PC clone and many other products.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					The new 600XL and 800XL would be the only XL's to be sold at 
					the end of 1983. However, even their sales were crippled 
					when Atari's new CEO James Morgan made a critical error in 
					judgment regarding their manufacture.&nbsp; Atari had an 
					existing manufacturing plant with Atari-WONG, It was ready 
					to build and ship the new XL's, however Atari's new ATMC 
					(Atari Taiwan Manufacturing Company) was not ready yet, but 
					if the XL's were made in that new plant, they would cost $30 
					less each but there would be a 30 day delay before they 
					could ship.&nbsp; James Morgan chose to wait the additional 
					30 days which caused Atari to lose the Christmas 1983 sales 
					season and gave an almost totally unchallenged market over 
					to Commodore for its C64 computers essentially giving 
					Atari's biggest rival a massive leg up in sales.</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">By January 1984 Atari decides 
					to revive the Atari 1450XLD.&nbsp; It would now be redone 
					from the ground up into a new board design under the project 
					codename &quot;TONG&quot; and it will be an all in one board with disk 
					drive controller built in.&nbsp; Also work on the Atari 
					1090XL Expansion system is in high gear.&nbsp; By March and 
					April of 1984 many of the expansion cards Atari had 
					announced were nearing completion.&nbsp; Also in March of 
					1984 Atari inks a critical deal with Amiga Corporation.&nbsp; 
					Amiga is out of money and to finish its &quot;Lorraine&quot; chipset 
					it is in serious need of capital. Atari and Amiga signed 
					into a contractual agreement that Atari would fund Amiga 
					$500,000 to complete the development of the Amiga chipset.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					Atari would get exclusive rights to use the chipset under 
					the Atari name for a new high-end game console.&nbsp;&nbsp; After one 
					year, Atari could then sell a keyboard upgrade for the game 
					console, plus utilize the technology in a new series of 
					Atari computer systems).</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">On June 30, 1984 Amiga was set 
					to deliver the chipset to Atari but backed out, instead it 
					had negotiated in breach of their contract with Commodore to 
					repay the loan back to Atari that Amiga had borrowed to 
					complete the Amiga chipset and Commodore bought Amiga.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					Atari was never able to produce both its 1850XL computer and 
					also its new high-end video game console which were both to 
					be based on the Amiga chipset technology.&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 13, 
					1984 Atari filed suit against Amiga for breach of contract 
					and use of technology that Atari had paid to be developed.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					The suit was settled in 1987, however it was a closed 
					decision and although rumors leaked that Atari won the suit, 
					no positive confirmation of this has been found to date.
					</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The electronics design of the 
					Atari XL series of computers were done in the New York 
					WCI/NY Atari research labs under Steve Mayer with Gregg 
					Squires as the head of Engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile in Atari's 
					Sunnyvale offices in the Industrial Design group headed by 
					Roy Nishi, Regan Cheng designed the all new look for Atari's 
					second generation of computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Going for a very 
					attractive high-tech look based on similarities to equipment 
					made by Bang &amp; Olufsen.&nbsp;Regan Cheng designed an all-new look 
					into what became the first Atari XL computer, the Atari 
					1200XL.&nbsp;It can probably be labeled the world's first stylish 
					and sexy looking computer system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
