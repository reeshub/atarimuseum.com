The Atari 1010 Program Recorder was the replacement to the Atari 400/800
lines Atari 410 Program recorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new 1010 was stylish
and simplistic to use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although no faster then any other standard
tape recorder/Program Recorder, the Atari 1010 was a reliable little unit
and was very popular in European markets where money was tight and the
majority of software was available on Tape Cassettes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What made the Atari Data/Program recorders unique from all other cassette
decks used on other home computers was its ability to tie into the Atari
Audio Summation Circuitry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 410,
1010 and the Atari XC11 &amp; XC12 Data/Program recorders all worked through
the Atari SIO (Serial I/O) bus, a data communications bus very similar
to today's USB (Universal Serial Bus).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Data/Program
recorders could all be controlled by the Atari computer and also channeled
their audio into the SIO bus and into the Atari computer where it would
be heard through a connected Television or Computer Monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Data/Program recorders also were Dual Track systems and could load
data while also playing audio/music tracks simultaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This meant that while another section of a program was loading, the recorder
could give the user instructions, information or play a soundtrack to occupy
the users time while the program loaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This system
was used extensively in Atari's unique and unparalleled line of educational
software.</font></font>
