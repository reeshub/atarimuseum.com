With the introduction of Atari all new XL line of computers came the all

new Atari 1030 direct connect modem.&nbsp;&nbsp; The modem had a very unique

feature packed into it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the Atari 850 interface,

the Atari 1030 modem had not only its device driver in ROM which would

automatically upload into the computers memory, but also its software as

well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 1030 came with an on-board software package

called ModemLink which would automatically upload into the computers memory.&nbsp;

However there was a catch, like all previous Atari software, ModemLink

had no provisions for Uploading or Downloading software, also in order

to use the on-board ModemLink software any disk drives that were connected

to your system had to be turned OFF.</font>

Later Atari 1030's were packaged with "The New Atari 1030 Software Package"

which was a diskette with Amodem, Tscope and DiskLink software.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Amodem was written by Jim Steinbrecher of Atari telecom fame, Tscope was

written by Joe Miller and was for use with Compuserve.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

DiskLink was a rather interesting an unique program in that it had pull

down menus and pop up windows, but it had limited features and use and

for better results Amodem and Tscope were better set for the task of doing

serious telecom work.</font>
