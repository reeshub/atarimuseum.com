ATARI 1090: XL EXPANSION SYSTEM</font></b></p>
      <hr>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="slide_image1.jpg" width="800" height="531"></p>
      <blockquote>

<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica">Originally 
spec'd out in Spring of 1983. The Atari 1090 XL Expansion was designed to 
provide the Atari XL series of home computers: 600XL, 800XL (Unreleased 1400XL &amp; 
1450XLD) with expansion slots. The XL Expansion System contained 5 8-bit PBI (Parallel Bus Interface) slots
which could accommodate a variety of expansion options. Also a control
line was added to the PBI to allow a "BUS MASTERING" card such as an alternative
CPU card to take over the Bus and in effect, take over the computer. This
would have allowed for alternative CPU configurations like an Intel 8086
processor for IBM compatibility or the 65816 processor which was the 16-bit
version of the 6502 processor used in all of the Atari 8-bit series computers.</font><p align="justify">
        <font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica">The design and 
        specification went through several revisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally it 
        was spec'd to have 8 expansion slots, to include an SIO interface card 
        for use with the original 800 and 1200XL computers (Or a 400 if 
        sufficient memory was installed) and would have an external buffering 
        box between it and the computer system called the &quot;Julie FIFO&quot; box - 
        FIFO meaning &quot;First In First Out&quot;.</font><font color="#000000"><br>&nbsp;
        </font>

<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica">The XL Expansion system appears to have been in a finished and completed
form.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a number of years in the 1990's Best Electronics had a 
large supply of the 1090XL chassis' and the 64K memory cards which they sold for 
a low cost.&nbsp;&nbsp; They did not include the metal case cover however.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
These were bought by the company through parts sales from Atari Corp which 
choose not to produce the product and had redesigned the XL series computers 
into lower cost XE series computers.</font><p align="justify">
        <font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica">The product design was complete and 
        plugging in an XL Expansion box to an XL computer with a 1064 memory 
        card in the box will increase the XL memory by 64K.&nbsp;&nbsp; A Z80 
        CP/M card - called the 1066 is in the Atari Museum, but no software or 
        drivers are available so its not able to be tested.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
        is reported that the Z80 CP/M would have worked with the 80 Column card 
        in the box to give the XL computers not only CP/M capability, but also 
        in 80 columns on the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari Museum has a partial 
        assembled 80 column board, their are no schematics available to complete 
        its assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.vghmuseum.com">
        <font color="#FF0000">National Video Game History Museum</font></a> in Texas has a 1090 Expansion 
        system with almost all of the proposed expansion cards in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica">The XL Expansion system would have opened
the doors for the Atari 8-bits and allowed them to grow in all new ways.
However in July of 1984 Atari, Inc was acquired by Jack Tramiel and like so many
innovative Atari projects, the 1090 XL Expansion system made it to the
garbage dumpster and not the Atari Retailers shelves.</font><font color="#000000">

The Atari 1090 XL had several expansion card specifications that were to be 
released by Atari for the 1090 such as: The 64kMR ram card, 80 Column Video 
card, Z80 CP/M card, Serial/Parallel card, X10/BSR Home Automation control card 
and a Prototyping card.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these cards were in fact designed and 
prototypes were built.&nbsp; Also the &quot;AMY&quot; sound processor was designed to work 
in the 1090 as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To view the Expansion cards and their
