The Atari Touch Tablet was a well designed and brilliant idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Giving the user the ability to use a virtual sheet of paper and pen, they
could draw, drag and drop, paint and erase images with the included Atari
Artist program.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps given more time, the Touch Tablet could
have been used for many other innovative ideas and perhaps vertical market
applications.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari CX-77 Touch Tablet was designed by
Tom Palecki formerly of Atari's Industrial Design group.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom
still has his own personal CX-77 on display in his office at Pear Design,
Inc. in California.</font></font>
