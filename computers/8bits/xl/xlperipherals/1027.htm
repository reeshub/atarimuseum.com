In 1983 when Atari introduced in new 600XL and 800XL computers they also
adding to their printer line the new Letter Quality Atari 1027 printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although quite slow, the printer produced very high quality printouts which
were excellent for professional quality reports, resumes and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari also was about to introduce its new AtariWriter word-processing program
and originally the AtariWriter software did not work with the 1027, but
Atari had the bug fixed before they began selling AtariWriter.</font></font>

but was never sold publicly.</font></font>
