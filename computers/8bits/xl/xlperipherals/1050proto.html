<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
is the prototype schematic of the Atari 1053 disk drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Atari 1053 would have looked exactly the same as the 1050 which the exception of
its nameplate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The drive would've been a full 360K disk drive that
was backward compatible with the Atari 1050 and the 810 disk drives</font>

Several years ago the Atari Museum salvaged almost 20 internal
Atari Engineering logbooks from Atari, Inc dating from 1981-1984.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two log books mention the design of a new Atari 1053 double-sided/double
density disk drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also after a conversation with one of Atari's
former Home Computer Division managers, it was also discovered that Atari engineers
were using a "slush" fund of left over money from previous projects and
were working on a side by side dual Atari 1050 unit with 2 Atari 1050's
set-up into an XL styled case that looked very similar to an Apple ][ dual
drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; As of yet, the whereabouts of this in-house prototype
are unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As always, the Atari Museum is searching out of the far corners of the world in search of this and
any and all other Atari projects.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

The Atari 1053 was among several proposed new disk drives Atari was looking
into developing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also Atari was looking to severe ties with
Tandon due to the poor reliability of its mechanisms, also it is noted
from several notes from engineering meetings that Tandon was ignoring recommendations
from Atari on fixes and updates to the 1050 drive line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari was looking at Sanyo, Sony, Hitachi, Seagate and several other companies
for 5.25", 3.5" and even 3" drive mechanisms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several new drives
were proposed including:</font>

Drive Drive</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Atari 1055 3.5" disk drive (prototypes
exist of these units, the case design was done by Tom Palecki)</font>
