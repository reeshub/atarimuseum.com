The Atari 1020 Color Printer was the only released color printer ever made
by Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp; It had a 40 column printing width and used 4 color
pens to combine and drawing up to 256 colors.&nbsp;&nbsp; The printer was
small and fairly quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp; It came packaged with Atari Graphics
cassette program (Later, Atari released Atari Graphics in cartridge form
and was shipped with the Atari CX-75 Light-pen in Cartridge form).&nbsp;&nbsp;
The printer was simple to use, you plugged it in, powered it on, draw your
pictures and printed, very straight forward and simple.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari's
1983 version of Plug N Play which so eagerly touted by today's software/hardware
manufactures.&nbsp;&nbsp; For printing color graphics in programs outside
of Atari Graphics, example code was included so that users could write their
own programs and use color printing with them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
