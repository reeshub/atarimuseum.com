The Atari 1064 was the only released Parallel Bus Interface (PBI) product
for the Atari XL line of computers by Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other produts
such as the Atari 1090XL Expansion system and the rumored Parallel Bus
disk drive were never released.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 1064 module gave
an Atari 600XL computer an additional 64K of memory (for a total of 80K).&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Atari 1064 memory modules interface will only fit into an Atari 600XL,
the Atari 800XL, 1400XL and 1450XLD computers have ports which would be
blocked by the memory module.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is assumed that Atari engineers
purposely designed it in just this particular way to aviod its use on any
other system other then the Atari 600XL.&nbsp;&nbsp; The module does have
a passthrough port on the back of it, so additional memory modules and
other Parallel Bus Interface (PBI) devices could have been daisy chained
to the back of it.</font>

This is the original prototype of the Atari 1064 memory module.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Inside is a wire-wrapped prototype board.&nbsp;&nbsp; The casing as you
can see from the above image is an all brown color.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps
Atari had originally intended the new XL line of computer to be completely
brown in color or brown was to be a dominant color in the case designs
of its components.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari Historical Society will
contact several of the Industrial Designers who had worked on the XL line
of cases to find out what the answer is to that question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The above module actually says "ATARI MEMORY MODULE", the completed and
released versions simple say "ATARI 1064" on them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also there
is an LED on the prototype case.&nbsp; The LED is non-functional and appears
to have been to there for cosmetic purposes only.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
