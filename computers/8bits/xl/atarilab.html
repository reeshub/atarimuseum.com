&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari
was eager to get a better foothold into the educational market with its
new XL series of computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past Atari with its 400/800
line of computers, Atari made some small in-roads into the educational
market by supplying schools with free 30-day trails of Atari computers
in hopes that once a classroom got to use an Atari computer the teachers
would not be able to let the computer go back after 30 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari also had a Black/Blue/Silver painted fleet of Atari Vans which went
around the California state to various schools with Atari computers to
gain interest in their use in schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari also gave
away Atari 800 computers to College freshman who's grades were high as
an additional incentive.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well it was time for Atari
to go back to school again, this time armed with all sorts of sensors,
experiments and learning guides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was time for AtariLab,
a series of educational modules which connected any Atari 8-bit computer
system to allow students to perform various science experiements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of course Apple kept a stronghold on the educational market and Atari,
even though it was able to chip away a little bit at the fortress that
Apple built, it never caught on the way Atari had truly hoped.
