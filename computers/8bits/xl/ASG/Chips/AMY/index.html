						<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial">The Atari AMY Sound Processor, like 
						so many other projects within Atari,&nbsp; has been 
						cloaked in some of the most deeply seeded Silicon Valley 
						lore, rumor, innuendo to just outlandish conspiracy 
						theories surrounding this highly advanced sound 
						processor.&nbsp; A chip developed in August 1983 that 
						had sound capabilities and quality that was 10 years 
						ahead of its time.</font></p>
						<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial">Yet the chip had numerous design 
						issues, was slated for a new next generation line of 
						16-bit Atari computer systems as part of the &quot;Rainbow 
						chipset&quot; (Silver, Gold and AMY) and was being discussed 
						throughout the company in various groups to be used in 
						other proposed designs. It was being considered for use 
						in next generation Atari game consoles and in the Atari 
						Arcade division.</font></p>
						<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial">When Atari was sold in July 1984 to 
						Tramel Technologies Ltd, which renamed itself to Atari 
						Corp, the AMY was examined by lead technologist Shiraz 
						Shivja, the father of the Atari ST.&nbsp; It was 
						considered for the new ST computer (codenamed RBP), but 
						with more development needed and a very tight schedule 
						and deadline, it would instead be considered for use in 
						an Atari 65XE computer designated the Atari 65XEM.</font></p>
						<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial">Issues continued with the AMY and it 
						would never materialize and this is where the classic 
						mystique of Atari lore kicks into high gear.&nbsp; Like 
						a Cold War spy thriller with people being silenced, 
						evidence being burned in a warehouse fire and spies 
						lurking behind every corner... A tinfoil hat conspiracy 
						theorists dream come true :-)&nbsp; </font></p><hr>
						<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial">So, theories aside, lets focus on 
						facts.&nbsp; So first things first.&nbsp; The credit for 
                        finally locating an actual fully intact AMY IC chip goes 
                        to John Hardie of the <b>

                        The Atari Musuem and the NVM work cooperatively with one 
                        another and John was extremely gracious in donating the 
                        AMY chip to the Atari Museum. </font></p>

						<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
						<font face="Arial">To the Left are links to a mother load of 
						technical documents, Chip simulation and design data, 
						network lists, software, harmonics and music creation 
						tools.&nbsp; So lets have at it, lets take all this data 
						and start to delve into the AMY and lets look into how 
						it functions, what issues it may have had so that they 
						can be corrected and try to reconstruct the chip logic 
						in Verilog and in Emulation.</font></p>
						<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">

						closely and lets see about the demo's and getting more

                        which describes how the chip works. I won't go into 
                        detail but it is very different from the way most 
                        synthesis systems work and it is my favorite way to 
                        synthesize sound.<br>
                        <br>
                        It was developed by Atari before we got there and they 
                        had working TTL versions that sounded GREAT but no 
                        working chips. Chips were due to arrive in weeks and we 
                        kept the project alive to see if they worked. They 
                        didn't. The designer didn't have a good explanation for 
                        what went wrong and being a full custom chip it would be 
                        quite expensive to continue. The project was shut down.<br>
                        <br>
                        A third party group that had done work with Atari, both 
                        Inc and Corp, said they were interested. A deal was 
                        reached where we would give them what we had and 
                        permission for the designer to work with them. The deal 
                        was that they could do whatever they liked with the 
                        resulting chip as long as we able to use the chips in 
                        our products. We would buy the chips from the 
                        manufacturer and pay them a royalty.<br>
                        <br>
                        After lots of false starts and details the 3rd party 
                        didn't share with us they eventually called me and 
                        announced that they had working chips that they wanted 
                        to demonstrate to us. I said great, let's get working on 
                        setting a royalty rate. They said they wouldn't let us 
                        use the chips for any price. This went back and forth 
                        MANY times. I reminded than that there were obligated to 
                        licence the chips to us and they agreed that was true 
                        but wouldn't do it.<br>
                        <br>
                        We sued. I flew to give court testimony about how the 
                        chip worked and why it was so unique. They agreed to 
                        licence the chips. We said great but nothing happened. 
                        We got word that they were going to demo the technology 
                        we said &quot;Great, what's our royalty arrangement?&quot; They 
                        said we couldn't use the chip. We filed a TRO to prevent 
                        them from demoing the technology. We won. They agreed to 
                        negotiate.<br>
                        <br>
                        More time passed and we flew out to meet with them but 
                        they kept agreeing and then denying that they had 
                        agreed. We refused to continue negotiations unless 
                        everything was put down on paper (it was a LONG time 
                        ago). We never got a deal, the technology never was 
                        released.<br>
                        <br>
                        I never heard a working AMY chip but I think they did 
                        exist because I worked with the head of the project at 
                        their end on other things and found him to be honest. He 
                        was not involved in any of the failed negotiations.<br>
                        <br>
                        This is a very high level synopsis with LOTS of detail 
                        missing but it has all of the information needed to 
                        understand the situation.&quot;</font></span></span></span></i></p>
