					<i><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The History of the Atari 
					XL Computer Systems</font></b></i></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial">In 1981 Atari began work on its 
					replacement to the Atari 400/800 computer systems in an 
					effort to keep them current with technologies, give them an 
					updated and more modern look and to reduce&nbsp; the cost of 
					manufacture.</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial">The first design went through numerous 
					project codenames:&nbsp; Z800, Sweet-16 and Elizabeth.&nbsp; 
					Eventually it would be called the Atari 1200 then 
					upon its release in January 1983 it would be officially 
					called the 1200XL. </font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial">The new Atari XL series was born.</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial">The Atari 1200XL originally would have a 
					simple 50 pin Buss Expander and 2 new 15 pin SIO connectors.&nbsp; 
					However during the summer of 1982, issues with RF noise in 
					the new 1200 design 
					and Atari wanted a more formalized and capable 
					expansion design. Marketing was not firm on how to move 
					forward with the system having different sized and designed SIO 
					connectors. So the 1200XL would be scaled back to a more closed 
					design so it could be released. Meanwhile Atari's engineering group would 
					use the additional months to&nbsp; formalize its 
					new &quot;PBI&quot; Parallel Bus Interface design and create a 
                    new OS to intelligently manage external parallel buss 
                    expansions devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial">While this initially sounds bad for the 
                    1200XL, it did allow Atari to officially announce its new 
                    computer on time in 
					December of 1982 and release it in January of 1983.&nbsp; 
                    Atari was now facing pressure from Commodore with its VIC20 
                    and now its C64 computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the 1200XL 
					would be a short term fix as the model would only be made 
					for 6 months with the intent of replacing it with its 
					original design (less the dual DB15 connectors) called the 
					Atari 1201XL.</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial">The 1200XL would start to arrive into 
					dealers by February 1983 and in March of 1983 the 
					specifications for the 600XL (codenamed: &quot;Surley&quot;) would be 
					completed. The 600XL would be the replacement to the Atari 
					400 as the 1200XL was the replacement to the Atari 800.&nbsp; 
					</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial">Atari, facing immediate negative feedback 
                    on the costing of the 1200XL, would have an additional 
                    version of the 600XL design in a slightly larger case and 
                    with 64K and composite which would be directed as the new replacement 
					for the 1200XL over the original idea of the 1201XL.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
					&quot;Surely Plus&quot; project became the&nbsp; 800XL and would be the 
					more affordable replacement for the 1200XL.</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial">Meanwhile the 
					1201XL was changed to have a built in modem and voice 
					synthesizer and would become the Atari 1400XL which was spec'd out along with the 1250XLD in June of 1983. By July 
					of 1983 production of the 1200XL's had ceased and it was 
					canceled.</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The 1250XLD would change to 
					become the 1450XLD, this would have a modem, voice 
					synthesizer and a built in parallel disk drive interface 
					with support for up to 2 360K high speed disk drives.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					All 4 of the new XL systems were expected to be ready for 
					sale by the fall of 1983.&nbsp; Atari's CEO, Ray Kassar 
					would be fired due to stock market insider trading and a 
					loss of confidence by Warner Communications CEO Steve Ross 
					in June of 1983.&nbsp; A new CEO for Atari was hired but he 
					wouldn't start until September and when he did.&nbsp; He 
					then came 
					into the company, put a 30 day hold of all work and canceled 
					all projects he felt would not benefit Atari.&nbsp; </font>
					</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the fall of 1983, the 1400XL and 1450XLD were 
					canceled, along with the Atari 1060 CP/M box, the Atari 1600XL 
					hybrid Atari/MS-DOS PC clone and many other products.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					The new 600XL and 800XL would be the only XL's to be sold at 
					the end of 1983. </font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, even their sales were crippled 
					when Atari's new CEO James Morgan made a critical error in 
					judgment regarding their manufacture.&nbsp; Atari had an 
					existing manufacturing plant with Atari-WONG, It was ready 
					to build and ship the new XL's, however Atari's new ATMC 
					(Atari Taiwan Manufacturing Company) was not ready yet, but 
					if the XL's were made in that new plant, they would cost $30 
					less each but there would be a 30 day delay before they 
					could ship.&nbsp; James Morgan chose to wait the additional 
					30 days which caused Atari to lose the Christmas 1983 sales 
					season and gave an almost totally unchallenged market over 
					to Commodore for its C64 computers. This essentially gave 
					Atari's biggest rival in the computer market a massive leg up in sales.&nbsp; 
					To compound this already bad decision, it is also decided to 
					RAISE the prices of the XL systems and video game systems.&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000"><b><a href="news-articles.html"><font color="#FF0000"> 
					(Read News Articles Timeline HERE)</font></a></b></font></font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">By January 1984 Atari decides 
					to revive the Atari 1450XLD.&nbsp; It would now be redone 
					from the ground up into a new board design under the project 
					codename &quot;TONG&quot; and it will be an all in one board with disk 
					drive controller built in.&nbsp; Also work on the Atari 
					1090XL Expansion system is in high gear.&nbsp; By March and 
					April of 1984 many of the expansion cards Atari had 
					announced were nearing completion.&nbsp; Also in March of 
					1984 Atari inks a critical deal with Amiga Corporation.&nbsp; 
					Amiga is out of money and to finish its &quot;Lorraine&quot; chipset 
					it is in serious need of capital. Atari and Amiga signed 
					into a contractual agreement that Atari would fund Amiga 
					$500,000 to complete the development of the Amiga chipset.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					Atari would get exclusive rights to use the chipset under 
					the Atari name for a new high-end game console.&nbsp;&nbsp; After one 
					year, Atari could then sell a keyboard upgrade for the game 
					console, plus utilize the technology in a new series of 
					Atari computer systems one year later.</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">On June 30, 1984 Amiga was set 
					to deliver the chipset to Atari but backed out, instead it 
					had negotiated behind Atari's back in breach of their contract 
					and made a deal with Commodore to 
					repay the loan back to Atari that Amiga had been paid to 
					complete the Amiga chipset and Commodore then bought Amiga.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					</font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Because of this contract breach 
					by David Morse of Amiga and the selling of Amiga to 
					Commodore, Atari was never able to produce both its Atari 1850XL computer and 
					also its new high-end video game console (Codenamed 
					&quot;Mickey&quot;) which were both to 
					be based on the Amiga chipset technology.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">On August 13, 
					1984 Atari Corp (The now newly owned Tramel Technologies 
					Company renamed to Atari Corp after it had bought Atari 
					Inc's home game &amp; computer divisions on July 2, 1984) filed 
					a lawsuit against Amiga for breach of contract 
					and use of technology that Atari had paid to be developed.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					The suit was settled in 1987, however it was a closed 
					decision and although rumors leaked that Atari won the suit, 
					no positive confirmation of this has been found to date. (If 
					you have any documented evidence of the Settlement, please

					<p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The electronics design of the 
					Atari XL series of computers were original started in the WCI/NY Atari research labs 
					in Manhattan, New York under Steve Mayer with Gregg 
					Squires as the head of Engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile in Atari's 
					Sunnyvale offices in the Industrial Design group headed by 
					Roy Nishi, Regan Cheng designed the all new look for Atari's 
					second generation of computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Going for a very 
					attractive high-tech look based on similarities to equipment 
					made by Bang &amp; Olufsen.&nbsp;Regan Cheng designed an all-new look 
					into what became the first Atari XL computer, the Atari 
					1200XL.&nbsp;It can probably be labeled the world's first stylish 
					and sexy looking computer system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
