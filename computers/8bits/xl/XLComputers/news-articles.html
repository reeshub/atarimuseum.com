							<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Kassar's 
							Autocratic management style of having to be central 
							to any and all decisions within Atari, coupled with 
							his lavish rewards to himself and his marketing and 
							sales managers while treating the engineering and 
							software employees as trivial and unimportant in his 
							view.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He repeatedly issued 
							constant cancellations of new products &amp; 
							technologies because they threatened sales of the 
							Atari 2600 VCS.&nbsp; This left Atari as a marketing 
							company without leading edge products to sell to 
							keep it ahead of an oncoming tsunami of competitors 
							with equal and/or better products. These actions had 
							destroyed the company from within.</font><p align="justify">
							<font face="Arial">As Kassar was fired and James 
							Morgan hired as his replacement, the beginnings of a 
							string of bad decisions coupled with poorly thought 
							out actions would again put Atari in a continued

							<font face="Arial">James Morgan accepted the new

							start work at Atari for 2 months, leaving the 
							company without a CEO or direction.&nbsp; Steve Ross 
							would call Ray Kassar and ask him return for 2 
							months as a consultant.&nbsp; After expressing his 
							shock and insult that Ross would fire him and then 
							ask him to return, the two came to an agreement and 
							Ray Kassar would continue on - only as a figure 
							head, for 2 months to save public face for Warner 
							Communications and Atari.&nbsp; Meanwhile Atari is 
							facing production issues which result in a delay of 
							the release of the Atari 800XL's, this delay will be 
							further worsened once James Morgan arrives in 
							September.</font><p align="center">

							<font face="Arial">James Morgan, by not starting in 
							July to give himself the needed time to get up to 
							speed with the state of the company, its projects, 
							goals and deadlines would be the first in a series 
							of initial critical error's on James Morgan's part.&nbsp; 
							He could have spent July through August assuming 
							lead roles in critical project decisions and also, 
							during the more relaxed days of summer, enacted his 
							30 day review period instead of doing it when he 
							came on board in September.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">For a consumer 
							electronics company, the months of September and 
							October are some of the most critical months to make 
							final preparations for manufacturing, shipping and 
							distribution of products for the all important 
							Christmas sales season where most companies can make 
							as much as 70% of their yearly revenue.&nbsp; 
							Instead James Morgan started his new position as CEO 
							in September. He then instituted a 30 day freeze on 
							all projects to evaluate the company.&nbsp; This was 
							the most serious tactical error on Morgan's part. 
							This would cripple the company's ability to function 
							and prepare things that needed to be readied.</font><p align="justify">
							<font face="Arial">What then followed were two of 
							the most serious error's James Morgan would make in 
							his entire time at Atari:&nbsp; The first: was his 
							choosing to delay manufacturing of the Atari 
							600/800XL computers for 30 days to have them built 
							in Atari's new plant instead of the existing one.&nbsp; 
							This new plant however, wasn't ready yet which was 
							the reason for the 30 day delay. This completely 
							destroyed any chance of Atari shipping product to 
							meet the 1983 Christmas retail season demand.&nbsp; 
							Atari would lose millions of dollars in badly needed 
							profit over this decision.</font><p align="justify">
							<font face="Arial">Even worse - Atari handed the 
							1983 Christmas sales season over to Commodore to 
							sell its products with practically no competition.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
							Atari desperately needed market share of its 
							computers out into the retailers for the 1983 
							Christmas season.&nbsp; This would further impact 
							Atari's post season sales because it would lose the 
							large amount of secondary purchases in January of 
							1984: Disk drives, printers, modems, software and 
							games.</font></blockquote>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The second 
							major mistake was the announcement on November 9th 
							that Atari would actually be RAISING its prices on 
							its two new computers, the 1027 printer and its 
							video game consoles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea was that 
							the market was spiraling to the bottom in pricing, 
							mostly due to Commodore, so James Morgan thought 
							that since Atari's computers were a much higher 
							quality (which compared to the utilitarian C64, they 
							were.)&nbsp;&nbsp; And he felt they should be priced 
							higher.&nbsp; However in a feature for feature 
							comparison, most consumers look more to the price 
							and many times will live with the lower quality 
							product.&nbsp; This whole price raising idea would 
							backfire and further hamper sales of Atari's new XL 
							computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; What Atari needed were new 
							higher end computers that could compete more with 
							the Apple ][ and IBM PC and be out of the feature 
							range of the VIC20 and C64 so as not to compete in 
							that level of pricing.</font><p align="center">

							<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The new higher 
							end machines, however, along with many other higher 
							end products were put on the chopping block and 
							canceled by James Morgan:&nbsp; The 1400XL &amp; 1450XLD 
							are canceled. So is the 1600XL IBM Compatible 
							system, the Atari 1060 CP/M module and the Atari 
							Graduate computer keyboard add-on for the Atari VCS.</font><p align="justify">
							<font face="Arial">However, there is a glimmer of 
							hope.&nbsp; As 1984 comes around, despite starting 
							off the year having to layoff nearly 1,000 
							employees, things begin to significantly change 
							within Atari's management structure and day to day 
							operations.&nbsp; Daily meetings, project status 
							reviews, progress reports, tighter budget management 
							have all been implemented.&nbsp; Groups within the 
							HCD (Home Computer Division) have been communicating 
							better, sharing idea's and project information.&nbsp; 
							Atari reinstates the Atari 1450XLD back onto the 
							schedule as a product to be released in 1984.&nbsp; 
							Also the Atari 1090 expansion box development moves 
							into high gear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Development of several 
							key expansion cards has been spec'd out and Atari 
							begins to hire outside contractors to design and 
							build these new cards.&nbsp; Among them, the former 
							contractor of the Atari 1060 CP/M box is now hired 
							to develop an 80 column card, CP/M card, LCD display 
							card, BSR/Realtime Clock card and an MS-DOS disk 
							drive compatible controller card.</font><p align="center">
