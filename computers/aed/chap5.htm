After the mishaps of 1982, Atari had a sobering wake up in the form of bad 
press, poor sales and bruised ego's.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1983 would be a year to change 
course and set about correcting many of its product line shortcomings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Several projects were begun in both the Consumer Electronics group and the Home 
Computer group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Consumer arena, engineering began 
to examine the possibilities of new game system designs, some were based around 
doing multi-TIA systems, combining the TIA and GTIA together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Others looked to a 3rd party company that had been developing some of Atari's 
2600, 5200 and home computer games called General Computer Corporation (GCC).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
They were now pitching a new game system based around a new graphics processor 
that could work side by side with the Atari TIA chip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Adding to this mix was a Japanese firm named Nintendo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
approached Atari to discuss licensing and distribution of their &quot;Famicom&quot; 
console in the United States under the Atari name.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So from the 
consumer front, there was a lot on the plate to choose from and bring to market.</font></p>

Meanwhile in the Home Computer division, 1983 would bring about some changes to 
the current home computer line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Newly designed replacement 
systems to put in place of the 1200XL were being readied - the 600XL (16K, RF 
only) computer and the 800XL (64K, RF and Composite video) computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Both sported something entirely new for any of Atari's home computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A new access panel was on the back of the systems - marked Expansion Bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This was Atari's new expansion port, a parallel bus that connected into all of 
the major IC's within the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plans were made to have an 
expansion chassis designed and built called the XL Expansion System.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This box would be a card cage for all sorts of cards and peripherals not 
possible on the previous 400, 800 or 1200XL computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
CPU cards, video cards, networking, hard drive controllers and more.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A whole new world of possibilities --- once the Expansion box was completed and 
released.</font></p>
