					<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Atari's 
					Advanced Engineering Division, which was a part of Corporate 
					Research, was a bridge between the Research think tank of 
					Atari and Atari's own Home Computer Division.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					Atari's Corporate Research was developing designs and 
					technologies that would be available in 7 to 10 years.&nbsp; 
					The idea was that since much of this &quot;Future&quot; technology did 
					in fact exist in the labs and in design specifications by 
					some of Silicon Valley's brightest minds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under 
					such visionaries as Chris Jeffers, Cynthia Solomon, Ted Hoff and Alan Kay.&nbsp; The &quot;ASRL&quot; (Atari Sunnyvale 
					Research Lab) was Atari's own version of
					<a href="https://parc.com/about-parc/parc-history">
					<font color="#FFFFFF">Xerox PARC</font></a>.</font><p align="left">
					<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">These technologies would 
					be productized and turned into commercially viable products 
					for the company to put out, not in 7 to 10 years but within 
					1 to 2 years.</font><p align="left">
					<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The core of much of this 
					new technology was centered around several remarkably 
					advanced chipsets.&nbsp;&nbsp; These chipsets rivaled and 
					even outperformed the famous &quot;Lorraine&quot; chipset of the 
					Amiga, the Macintosh and The Mindset Corp computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					</font>
					<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">New 
					computer designs were being spec'd out and were in the works 
					to utilize these new technologies.&nbsp; Atari was looking 
					to enter the 16 bit computer field by the end of 1984 and 
					early 1985.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, Atari's parent company, run 
					by Steve Ross - Warner Communications, wanted to unload 
					Atari desperately, despite the fact that while Atari was 
					loosing a great deal of money, it was positioning itself to 
					make a monumental comeback by the end of 1984 in both the 
					video game and home as well as small business computer 
					fields. Steve Ross would practically give Atari away to the former head of Commodore.&nbsp;These 
					advanced Atari Inc. technologies were disregarded or were unknown to 
					Shiraz Shivji, the new head of Atari engineering and they 
					would never see the light of day until now.</font><p align="left">
					<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">When Atari was being sold 
					to the Tramiels, Tedd Hoff was given permission to take 
					RAINBOW and try to pitch it to other companies.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					Most of the Corporate Research and Advanced Engineering 
					teams ended up at HP.</font></blockquote>
