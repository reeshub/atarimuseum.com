</i></b>Before we continue forward, lets take a step back to 1976...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Up in Northern California, at a design consulting firm founded by two former 
Ampex employee's - Larry Emmons and Steve Mayer, called Cyan Engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Located in Grass Valley, CA. this would become Atari's &quot;Think Tank&quot; were many of 
Atari's most innovative technologies during its early years would be born.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Among these technologies would be a design for a multipurpose microprocessor 
based video game console codenamed &quot;Stella&quot;.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
After the initial designs were completed, the project and some of its engineers 
(Steve Mayer and a new engineer named Joe Decuir)&nbsp; would move down to 
Atari's Sunnyvale headquarters to finalize the design, have marketing create a 
plan and move it to a production phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this 
time the project was put under one of Atari's new project leaders - a man by the 
name of Jay Miner.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Steve Mayer recalls:</font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><i>
<font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Initially Jay didn't know or understand much about 
video processing</font></i></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">methods and technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he 
was like a sponge and whatever we</font></i></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><i>
<font face="Arial" size="2">had shown him he immediately picked up on, learned 
and things went</font></i></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><i>
<font face="Arial" size="2">from there.&quot;</font></i></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

<font face="Arial">With that the new &quot;TIA&quot; (Television Interface Adapter) chip 
was born and with it, the legendary Atari 2600 &quot;VCS&quot; (Video Computer System).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Not sitting on their laurels, the chip design team under Jay Miner's direction 
move forward to produce a follow up chipset for a next generation video game 
system with a chipset that would have applications also in within Atari's 
coin-operated Arcade division as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The design 
would be much too big to fit into a costly and expensive higher pin number chip, 
so instead it was broken down into several individual 40 pin packages.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
These new chips would be:</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">POKEY 
(POtentiometer and KEYboard controller - also to handle sound)</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">ANTIC 
(Alpha Numeric Transactor IC - DMA control and some graphics control)</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">CTIA/GTIA 
- Colleen Television Interface Adapter/George's Television Adapter - Graphics 
IC)</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The team would consist of Jay Miner, Joe Decuir, Doug Neubauer, George McLeod 
and one other IC designer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the course 
of the chipset development, Atari took on a new strategy - to compete in the 
home computer field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This new advanced system chipset would 
wind up being used specifically for Atari's new Home Computer line, and the 
POKEY audio chip would also find its way in many of Atari's coin-op Arcade 
machines over the following years.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Trouble began to brew within Atari and within its IC Design leader shortly after 
this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through some fancy financial wrangling, 
Atari was able to make its new computer division look just barely profittable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This meant that the big fat bonus' promised to its IC design team would not 
materialize.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To add further insult to injury, with the 
new computers rolling off of the assembly line, peripherals and software being 
developed and sold it was time to look forward...</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Jay Miner pitched his next idea to Atari management.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that 
they had established their new computer division and their current computers 
were selling well, it was time to begin work on the next computer design.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Jay wanted to look at a next generation system based around the work completed.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Taking the current chipset farther with larger memory, better graphics and 
resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would mean developing a 16bit computer system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Management had just settled into this new venture and was content to see where, 
if any place, it might take Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be too costly to 
now invest again in an entirely new computer design when they already had a 
design which seemed solid and useable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer back to Jay 
Miner would be a resounding &quot;No&quot; and with that, it was time for Jay Miner to 
look elsewhere to make his vision a reality.</font></p>
