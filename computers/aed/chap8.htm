<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things were going quite 
well for Atari up until the summer of 1983.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Atari's parent 
company - Warner Communications was about to shake things up and things around 
Atari changed in several ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ray Kassar - former Textile 
Executive brought in by Warner Communications to be the CEO of Atari in 1978 was ousted from 
Atari over his questionable stock trading during December of 1982.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
While the management switch occurred, Nintendo grew impatient that their deal 
with Atari for its Famicom had not been completed, so Nintendo ended 
negotiations and went off on its own.&nbsp; In 1985 Nintendo would return with 
its NES &quot;Entertainment System&quot;.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GCC (General Computer 
Corp) was now in full swing 
of developing the new &quot;3600&quot; video game console for Atari based around its &quot;MARIA&quot; graphics 
processor.&nbsp;&nbsp; This new game console would be backward compatible with 
Atari's 2600 and ready for June 84.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial">Warner decided to hire 
James Morgan from Philip Morris as Atari's new CEO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
After accepting the position, he took a 2 month &quot;vacation&quot; and then upon taking 
the reigns in September 1983 decided to put ALL projects on hold while he 
examined the company, its products, projects and capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
On top of this, holiday shipments needed to be started immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
However, given a decision between producing Atari's computers in its new plant 
which would take 30 days to gear up and produce them at a lower cost or continue 
producing in the current factory at a slightly higher cost, James Morgan's delay 
cost Atari the entire 1983 holiday computer selling season, leaving Atari's main 
competitor - Commodore, free and clear to literally own home computer sales for 
1983.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, after James 
Morgan completed his review of the company, its products and its future, he 
canceled many strategic products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Casualties were the 
Atari 1400XL, 1450XLD, 1600XL PC Computer, CP/M box, Computer add-on for the 
Atari 2600 and several other products.</font></p>
