<font face="Arial">It had always been assumed that Atari was no longer making 
any efforts to vastly improve its home computer line of products.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Publicly, with the ill-fated release of the Atari 5200 in 1982 which was an over 
engineered version of the Atari 400.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was designed to make 
it as incompatible as possible with the home computer software/hardware systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Soon to follow was the equally ill-fated Atari 1200XL home computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
While it slimmed down and cost reduced the original Atari 800 configuration down 
to a single motherboard, it offered little in the way of major enhancements over 
the original 1979 Atari 800 design.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="800xlsetup.jpg" width="509" height="398"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
1983, the public saw the release of two new computer systems - the Atari 600XL 
and 800XL home computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially these were peer 
replacements to the Atari 400 and 800 computers and with their introduction came 
the discontinuation of the Atari 1200XL computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again these 
new systems, while offering some minor improvements were still only incremental 
enhancements, not major leaps forward from the original 1979 designs.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Two additional systems were announced which were the Atari 1400XL and the 
1450XLD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These were essentially versions of the Atari 
800XL systems with built in features such as modems and voice synthesizers.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In the case of the XLD system, a high speed double sided/double density disk 
drive was built in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These were stepping stone 
enhancements and yet again, nothing revolutionary in enhancing or upgrading the 
original Atari 800 design from 1979.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Meanwhile, out of sight of CES displays, reporters and public view there was 
quite a bit going on within Atari's Advanced Engineering Division.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The 6502 Processor had been at the heart of nearly every Atari product since the 
Atari 2600 VCS and while it was a capable workhorse - it was showing its age, 
and its limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was time for Atari to make some 
changes...</font></p>
