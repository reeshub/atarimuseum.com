<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Since 1975, Atari was a pioneering company 
with its own in-house custom IC circuit design group.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead by Harold 
Lee who laid out Atari's very first custom chip - the Home Pong IC, Atari would 
go on to create dozens of its own custom IC chips for its home game consoles, 
home computers and even its coin-op arcade games.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">While the 6502 CPU was a true workhorse, 
publicly most thought Atari did not see that its 8bit days were numbered.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Well, internally, Atari was in fact working since 1981 on its own 16bit upgrade 
to the 6502. The Atari 6502 was codenamed &quot;Sally&quot; The 16-bit CPU was codenamed 
&quot;Lynda&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is an email from Gary Summers, the former head 
of Atari's ASG (Atari&nbsp; Semiconductor Group):<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><em class="bbc"><br>
&quot;When I joined Atari in 1981 one of my first assignments was to work on a true 
16-bit<br>
upgrade, software compatible version of the 6502, as one did not exist. The chip<br>
manufactured by Synertek and Rockwell at the time was not acceptable as it would 
not<br>
allow older Atari games to play with the new system, i.e. it was not upward<br>
compatible with the older 6502. This then gave rise to my development work on 
the<br>
&quot;Lynda&quot; chip, which was an upward compatible version of the older 6502 family 
and<br>
had true 16-bit features, not &quot;pseudo&quot; 16-bit. I hired Mr. Fox, again as a<br>
consultant to this project as he was familiar with the older architecture. 
During<br>
this time frame, i.e. 1982 I was promoted to Vice President and General manager 
of<br>
Atari's Semiconductor Group and subsequently turned the &quot;Lynda&quot; project over the<br>
Atari's Home Computer group. As you can imagine, the NIH factor entered into the<br>
equation and I never heard about the project again. When I left Atari in July 
1984,<br>
it was my understanding from Mr. Tramiel that his intention was to sell all of 
the<br>
previous chip development projects which were not completed to outside sources. 
If<br>
this is indeed what happened then perhaps Mensche bought the rights to 
&quot;Lynda&quot;-who<br>
knows. It sounds as though the 65816 was another design, perhaps Synertek's,<br>
licensed to Atari, as it was my understanding that &quot;Lynda&quot; was never finished.&quot;</em></font></p>
