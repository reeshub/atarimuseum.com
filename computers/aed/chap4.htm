Jay Miner would part ways with Atari and in a kismet of irony, would join up 
with another disenchanted former Atari employee from Atari's consumer game 
programming group - Larry Kaplan...</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial">Before this 
would happen, Jay Miner was approached by a engineer who started a new chip 
design company called Xymos where he worked for a short while.&nbsp; So with some 
stock investment in this new Silicon Valley startup Jay did some chip design.&nbsp; 
In the first months of 1982 Jay received a call from Larry Kaplan of Activision.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Larry wasn't happy at Activision and threw the idea of he and Jay getting 
together to start up their own company on the table.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with Jay's 
stock in Xymos and some finance from some East Coast investors they were off and 
running.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an weird turn of events, Amiga would open a small 
office on Scott Boulevard in Santa Clara, CA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Atari's 
original office of all places!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with a new 
office in place, they got a Texas millionaire to put up some money as he had a 
strong interest in being on the ground floor of a new video game company.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
So, Larry would be in charge of producing video game software and Jay&nbsp; had 
some idea's about designing a games console that could be upgraded to become a 
real computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole part about the game console being able to 
become a computer was keep quiet from investors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Jay headed over 
Santa Clara from Xymos.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi Toro was chosen as the name for the new 
company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However the investors did not like the name and 
eventually gave Larry and Jay the new name for their company -&nbsp; &quot;Amiga&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Reluctantly the name was accepted, and it turned out it was a good decision as 
the name was approachable and accepted by all who heard it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now it was 
time to assembly the &quot;A&quot; Team....&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay specifically wanted people who 
could see along side him his vision and to share his commitment and passion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He didn't want people just looking for a paycheck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Dave Morse, Amiga's new President would be one such person and the game console 
project reflected this - the project would be codenamed &quot;Lorraine&quot; after his 
wife. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay Miner 
arranged an interesting working and compensation in the company:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We 
worked out a deal whereby I got a salary and some stock and I also got to bring 
my dog Mitchy into work every day.&nbsp; Dave did reserve the right to go back on 
that one if anyone else objected but Mitchy was very popular.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mitchy was no 
stranger to the world of high-tech engineering...&nbsp;&nbsp; He used to come to 
work at Atari when Jay was working there.&nbsp; In fact Mitchy even had his own 
security badge as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only other &quot;non-human&quot; to have a 
security badge at Atari was &quot;Kermit&quot; - a robot designed by the engineers at 
Atari's Grass Valley think-tank.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Jay Miner Commented about his time and work at Amiga:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Being able to 
take my dog to work set the tone for the whole atmosphere of the place.&nbsp; It was 
more than just companionship with Mitchy - the fact that she was there meant 
that the other people wouldn't be too critical of some of those we hired, who 
were quite frankly weird.&nbsp; There were guys coming to work in purple tights and 
pink bunny slippers.&nbsp; Dale Luck looked like your average off-the-street homeless 
hippy with long hair and was pretty laid back.&nbsp; In fact the whole group was 
pretty laid back.&nbsp; I wasn't about to say anything - I knew talent when I saw it 
and even Parasseau who spread the word was a bit weird in a lot of ways.&nbsp; The 
job gets done and that's all that matters.&nbsp; I didn't care how solutions came 
about even if people were working at home.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;There were a lot of various arguments and the way most 
were sorted out was by hitting each other with the foam baseball bats.&nbsp; The 
stung a bit if you got hit hard.&nbsp; There was a conflict in the fundamental design 
philosophy with some like RJ Mical wanting the low cost video game (the 
investors side, you might say).&nbsp; Others like Dale Luck and Carl Sassenrath 
wanted the best computer expansion capability for the future.&nbsp; This battle of 
cost was never ending, being internal; among us as well as with the investors 
and Commodore.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;You go through stages in any large project like the Amiga 
of thinking &quot;This looks great and it's going to sell really well&quot;, and then 
things go wrong and you just want to quit!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The unique spirit at Amiga was such that people worked 
tirelessly on their various projects, remembering that the software was well on 
the way to completion before any silicon had been pounded into the graphics 
chips.&nbsp; Carl Sassenrath was brought in to do the operating system and was asked 
at the interview &quot;What would you like to design?&quot;.&nbsp; He just replied that he 
wanted<br>
to do a multi-tasking operating system, and thus was born the Exec which lies at 
the very heart of the Amiga.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Meanwhile.....</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In 1982 we would see the dawn of Hi-Toro/Amiga.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile another 
startup company was already in the works as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; This too would be 
filled with former Atari employee's.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact their new founder and 
President would be the former head of Atari's Home Computer Division - Roger Baderscher.&nbsp;&nbsp; This other new computer company?&nbsp;&nbsp; Mindset 
Computer Corporation.&nbsp; They too would look to create a machine that would 
break the early computer graphics barriers and would create a semi-PC compatible 
using the Intel 80186 processor along with a set of new graphics chips of their 
own design.</font></p>
