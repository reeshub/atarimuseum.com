<font face="Arial">New Years 1984 had arrived, and with it, a new year, new 
start and new projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them was a set of new 
chips laid out as part of project &quot;Rainbow&quot; - a set of new high-res graphics chips 
called &quot;Silver and Gold.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also an audio processor called &quot;Amy.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Samples would be ready around March to begin integration into test systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This project was originally started under Atari's Corporate Research Group headed 
by Chris Jeffers and would eventually find its way into the hands of Advanced 
Engineering.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial">Meanwhile, in the Home 
Computer group, a project rises back from out of the ashes... the Atari 1450XLD 
is brought back on deck and put back on as a product to complete and release in 
the summer of 1984 along with the Atari 1090 XL Expansion System.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The 1450XLD was redesigned from its original 1983 design.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The project was now called &quot;TONG&quot; and would incorporate several new gate chips 
for handling device selection within the system (Modem, Voice Synthesizer and 
Disk Drive(s)) and would potentially be able to handle more memory directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The new prototype motherboard design was huge by any standard of the day, close 
to the size of an IBM PC/AT motherboard in fact.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Elsewhere, another machine was getting a lot 
of attention.&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind closed doors at the January 1984 CES a lot of 
whispering and rumors abound of an amazing new graphics computer by a company 
called Amiga Corp was being shown.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was called &quot;Lorraine&quot; and was 
the talk of show.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within those closed doors John 
Ferrand, Ken Nussbacher and other Atari management were meeting with Dave Morse, 
Jay Miner and other Amiga personnel to continue their discussions on Atari 
financing the development of this amazing system and to obtain usage of the 
system for possible use in both its video games division and its home computer 
division.</font></p>
