<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several weeks of 
back and forth throughout February 1984, David Morse of Amiga and John Ferrand 
of Atari come to basic 
terms on a Letter of Intent between Atari and Amiga.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Which would include Atari advancing to Amiga $500,000 on signing of the LOI so 
that Amiga could 
continue its funding and development of the &quot;Lorraine&quot; while Atari and Amiga 
worked on creating and getting signed a Licensing Agreement which Atari would then pay Amiga another $1,000,000 
at the signing of the license.&nbsp; Then upon each of the 3 chips delivered to Atari, Amiga would then receive 
$500,000 for delivery of each chip for a total of $3,000,000.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The initial offering of a License between 
Amiga and Atari would grant Atari exclusive usage of the Amiga chipset for its 
videogame business.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari would receive non-exclusive usage of 
the chipset in the home computer business, but that Atari could not do anything 
in the computer field until 1985 and only as a keyboard upgrade to its videogame 
system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1986 Atari could then sell a dedicated computer 
system based on the chipset.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would allow Amiga the ability to 
market and sell its own system without competition in the computer field from 
its licensor - Atari.</font></p>
