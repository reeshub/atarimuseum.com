While the public awaited the arrival of the &quot;Next Generation&quot; computers from 
Atari, rumors leaked about a computer from Atari, one that was very different 
from anything Atari had done in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A computer that was 
{gasp} IBM PC Compatible of all things.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rumors were in fact 
quite true.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari's Advanced Engineering was working initially on 
its own, then in the summer of 1983, began talk of a joint project with Toshiba 
to build not just a PC Compatible system, but a dual processor system that in 
one mode would run as an Atari 8bit XL computer and in another mode, would run 
as an IBM PC compatible (well - semi-compatible).&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would have both a 6502 
and a 80816 CPU on the motherboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Would have all of the Atari 
custom IC chips, but would share memory, I/O and video.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
system was called the Atari 1600XL (Internally the project was codenamed &quot;Shatki&quot;, 
it was also called the Atari 25601.</font></p>
