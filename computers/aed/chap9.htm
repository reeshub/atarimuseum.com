<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the dust settled 
from the major changes within Atari with James Morgan's arrival, several other 
things occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari's Consumer Electronics Division and Atari's 
Home Computer Division were merged together to become the Atari Products Group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Software development still stayed mostly the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In early November 1983 
Atari took notice of a small Silicon Valley start up, previously called Hi-Toro, 
now renamed Amiga.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their new chip designs had been completed by some 
former Atari engineers who were now working there - Jay Miner and Joe Decuir.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
These new chips were for&nbsp; a new game system/computer capable system called 
&quot;Lorraine&quot; and Atari was curious as to the very close similarities of its design 
to previous work done by both engineers just a few years ago while working for 
Atari on its home computer chipset.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On November 21, 1983 Atari 
and Amiga signed an agreement to discuss possible further business between the 
two companies and delivered to Atari specifications of its &quot;Lorraine&quot; system and 
its early business plan.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently the talks and 
exchange of information must have gone very well during the initial November 
meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Atari on December 20, 1983 during a high level 
budget meeting, in Steve Bristow's engineering log, he writes down the future product 
plan of projects for the Atari Home Computer Division, among them is the mention 
of a new system called the &quot;Atari 1850XL: 68000 based clones of Amiga game 
player system.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile in December 1983 
a group of engineers formerly with Coin-op had moved over to work in Atari's 
Home Computer Group in the Advanced Engineering Division.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Their first project:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;GAZA&quot; --- </font></p>
