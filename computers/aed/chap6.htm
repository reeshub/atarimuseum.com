<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>No 
its still 1983, not 1987 and the Next Generation was a marketing slogan tag for 
Atari's new &quot;XL&quot; computer line and not a reference to Star Trek - The Next 
Generation...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the 
finalized 600XL and 800XL were preparing for dealer shelves, Atari engineers 
were still at work on two additional &quot;XL&quot; computers - the 1400XL and the 
1450XLD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Now of interesting note: the Atari 1400XL was 
internally codenamed the Atari 1201XL as it was originally designed back in 
spring of 1982 as what the original Atari 1200XL computer was supposed to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The 1200XL (codenamed Sweet-16) had an earlier sibling and it was codenamed 
&quot;Elizabeth&quot; which was a 1200XL with a 50 pin expansion bus header on it.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last minute in the summer 
of 1982 the design was radically changed, its enhanced 15 pin SIO ports were 
replaced with a standard SIO port, and the expansion bus disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
So with the new system (1400XL) having a modem and voice synthesizer added, 
essentially it would be a step up from the 1200XL original design, so it was 
internally designated the Atari 1201XL</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial">The other &quot;Next 
Generation&quot; system was the Atari 1450XLD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially the very 
same motherboard as the 1400XL, but with power and expansion header on the 
inside to allow a disk drive controller daughterboard to plug into it to control 
up to 2 disk drives.</font></p>

ready to ship for the 1983 holiday season...&nbsp; or so everyone thought.</font></p>
