<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+3>History
Notes:&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size=+2>Atari ST Line of Computers</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size=+1>On
July 2, 1984 Warner Communications sold its Consumer Electronics Division
and its Home Computer Division to Tramiel Technologies, Ltd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From that day on, Atari's immediate new image and product line would be
computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using Atari's highly visible name, the Tramiels
set out to produce a sell an all new line of computer systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These systems were originally based on the National Semiconductor 32032
chip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The N32032 supply in quantities and cost range
were in doubt, so the MC68000 was chosen instead.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the
Home Computer Division employees, only those with Operating System skills
and 68000 skills were retained, nearly all other engineers were let go.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari's Industrial design team was also let go and in a matter of months,
all key positions were filled by former Commodore employees loyal to Jack
Tramiel.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new
Atari Computer division set out to produce a low cost computer system for
the masses with power and performance, without a heafty price tag, so became
Atari's new slogan:&nbsp; "Power without the Price".</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However
in a rush to put out the new system and get a market share before Commodore's
newly acquire Amiga system was to be released, certain corners were cut
on the new "ST" systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; The OS was not as refined as it could've
been and also it was not in ROM, but instead on supplied diskettes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This issue was quickly rectified a few months later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Newer systems came out such as the worlds first 1MB personal computer:&nbsp;
the Atari 1040ST, later improvements included the 1040STf with built in
disk drive and RF modulator to connect it to a television set.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A big
improvement model came in the form of the Mega ST system with its pizza
box design, detachable keyboard which everyone demanded, a Mega-Bus expansion
slot for video, networking and memory expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stackable
hard drives were also made available.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new laser printer
was also introduced along with the Mega ST called the SLM804.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A Mega ST with laser printer and desktop publishing software actually cost
as much as the laser printers alone from IBM and Apple.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major
improvements came with the Mega STe line with its new stylish case design,
lan port, use of SCSI hard drives, VME expansion and more importantly the
Blitter chip graphics processor which had been promised since the ST's
were first released giving the ST line faster graphics updates, more colors
and range of colors.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ST
went outbound with the release of the STacy laptop, this 15lb behemoth
was a blessing from ST users and more importantly... musicians who had
taken an almost cult following to the ST line of computers because it was
the only computer to offer built-in MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)
ports and ease of use with its graphically OS based on CP/M 68K using Digital
Research, Inc's GEM (Graphic Environment Manager) for its graphic front
end.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long
rumored and delayed Atari TT030 made its debut, a power house system originally
intended to run Atari's UNIX system V version 4.0, this workstation packed
a punch with a 32mhz 68030, Blitter, SCSI, Local-talk(tm) LAN port, 3 serial
ports and much much more.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, problems with the system
forced a limited UNIX version release and the more mainstream release using
Atari's latest version of TOS (The Operating System).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1991
Atari had shown two remarkable systems designed to showcase Atari technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They were called the Atari STbook and the Atari STPad "STylus", one was
an Atari laptop which weighed in at only 5lbs.&nbsp;&nbsp; A truly remarkable
feat especially when you take into account only a year before Apple released
its Macintosh Portable which weighed almost as much as the previous 15lb
STacy laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The STBook was released in limited numbers
(approx 1,000) and most were in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second product
was even more incredible, the STpad was a pen based tablet computer based
on Atari ST technology.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only 1 known fully assembled prototype
is known to exist and is part of the Atari Historical Society museum.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A mock-up case of another is in the possession of a European collector.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari
final product, the Atari Falcon030 was Atari's last shining ST star, with
even better graphics then all previous systems, built in Motorola DSP (Digital
Signal Processor), direct audio-to-hard drive recording, plus AtariWorks
office suite on its built in IDE hard disk, the Falcon was a wonderful
system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its only shortcomming was that it was packaged into
the old Atari 1040ST casing instead of a detachable keyboard design.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Such a design was in the works called the MicroFalcon, also a larger Pizza-box
version called the Falcon040 was in the works, but these were cancelled
as all work was directed towards Atari's last and greatest product, the
Atari Jaguar 64 Interactive Multimeadia system.</font></font>
