                    <font face="Arial">When you think of Atari 16-bit computers, 
                    most people think of the Atari ST's developed in the later 
                    part of 1984 after Jack Tramiel purchased the Consumer and 
                    Home Computer divisions of Atari Inc. from Warner 
                    Communications for $75 million in cash and $240 million in 
                    debentures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="left">
                    <font face="Arial">Many people did not know that prior to 
                    the sale of Atari on July 2, 1984 that Atari Inc. while 
                    still under the ownership of Warner Communications had 
                    several 16-bit computer designs in the works and several 
                    in-house chipsets in development that rivaled even the 
                    famous &quot;Lorraine&quot; chipset from Amiga.</font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="left">
                    <font face="Arial">Atari Inc, throughout 1983 in it's Home 
                    Computer Division, was actively researching 16-bit computer 
                    systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact Atari's own Corporate Research 
                    facility at 1196 Borregas had nearly 20 Apple Lisa systems 
                    in use and many within Atari were looking at the idea of an 
                    Atari version of the Apple Lisa...</font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="left">
                    <font face="Arial">Meanwhile in 1983 a group of former 
                    coin-op engineers proposed to Warner Communications an idea 
                    of Atari developing a high end graphics workstation.&nbsp; 
                    Atari already had several Symbolic systems that were in fact 
                    used to developed the ground breaking computer animation 
                    sequence for Superman III.&nbsp; This caught the attention 
                    of this group and they wanted Atari to develop a similiar 
                    system.</font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="left">
                    <font face="Arial">Later that year in 1983 the Home Computer 
                    group started to looking into the spec's for a project 
                    called the 1650XLD, this would be a &quot;Lisa&quot; type system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    At the same time, the HCD group had its first meetings with 
                    Amiga and wanted to learn more about this system they were 
                    developing and of interest was that is was strikingly 
                    familiar in its design to the Atari &quot;Colleen&quot; chipset.</font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 30; margin-right: 30" align="left">
                    <font face="Arial">Meanwhile another independent group that 
                    was formed would be a design committee... their project was 
                    called &quot;Sierra&quot; and sadly it never made it past committee 
                    arguments.</font></p>

                    <font face="Arial">In Corporate Research, a group that was 
                    developing technologies that were 10 years or more ahead of 
                    its time - called SARL (Sunnyvale Advanced Research Lab) was 
                    developing a new chipset called &quot;Rainbow&quot; that could be used 
                    in future 16 and 32 bit computer designs...</font></p>
