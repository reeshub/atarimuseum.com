<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#89BFE8">This is still as yet unconfirmed, 
but what you may be looking at above is the concept case for the Atari &quot;Sierra 
68000&quot; Project or the Gaza Project. Atari was already looking into the 
possibilities of a new high end computer system based around the Motorola 68000 
CPU and utilizing a new chipset being designed by at the Sunnyvale Advanced 
Research Centre in California. The chipset was called &quot;Silver &amp; Gold&quot;. Another 
system even more impressive then Sierra was GAZA, a MC68000 multiprocessor based 
graphics system was also designed. Using a chipset called Rainbow, several 
prototypes of the GAZA system had been completed and had 2 MC68000's working 
together using CP/M-68K. Originally Warner management took a liking to the 
project, but later on felt it conflicted with Atari's overall purpose of being 
an entertainment company so the plug was pulled. When the Tramiels arrived, they 
had no idea that completed prototypes of what may very have been systems far 
superior to the ST's and the Amiga's were already completed. The GAZA staff was 
fired, two of the engineers went onto to Digital Research, Inc. <br>
<br>
<br>
The case design may look familiar to some. It very closely resembles the Apple 
/// computer, except the Sierra sports two 3.5&quot; diskette drives. Additional 
photo's will follow in the coming weeks and hopefully more data will follow as 
well. Photo was taken in November 1983. Tom Palecki of Atari's Industrial Design 
group graciously donated the above photo's and the slides which will be 
converted into photo's.</font></td>
