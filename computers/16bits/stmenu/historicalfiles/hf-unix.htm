<p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify">
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#89BFE8">When the original specifications for 
the Atari TT030 workstation were released, Atari stated that the system would be 
able to run UNIX. Older then Atari itself, Unix is a very powerful open 
operating system used widely in most academic, research and corporate 
institutions. Atari had an opportunity to show the world that it too could 
compete against other systems in the workstation market. However, even after the 
TT030 was finished and the new operating system was complete, Atari backed out 
of the chance to enter the workstation market feeling it just didn't have the 
credentials to compete with the big boys, so Unix was made available, but it was 
never pushed or advertised by the company. </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify">
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#89BFE8">Instead as Atari had promised, they 
made sure that a new version of TOS/GEM would run on the TT030's. However, other 
companies saw the Atari platform as a viable and useful system for their 
flavours of Unix, so LINUX a Unix clone was made for the Atari's and so was 
BSD/ATARI Unix as well. Those individuals who had had the chance to experience 
the power of Unix on their ST's have joined the ranks of many other in enjoying 
such a powerful and versatile operating system. <br>
