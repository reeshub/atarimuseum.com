The Atari 1040ST was Atari's 1MB version ST, it also included several new
enhancements included a new version of TOS which was ROM based.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's new features weren't a grand leap forward (with the exception of the
Blitter which was introduced later) but its increased memory and OS in
ROM were a step in the right direction.&nbsp; However competition from
IBM, Apple and Amiga were getting strong by the minute and the 1040ST did
not represent as big a leap forward as the others were starting to make
with their systems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
