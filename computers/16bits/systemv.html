When the original specifications for the Atari TT030 workstation were released,
Atari stated that the system would be able to run UNIX.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Older then Atari itself, Unix is a very powerful open operating system
used widely in most academic, research and corporate institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari had an opportunity to show the world that it too could compete against
other systems in the workstation market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, even
after the TT030 was finished and the new operating system was complete,
Atari backed out of the chance to enter the workstation market feeling
it just didn't have the creditials to compete with the big boys, so Unix
was made available, but it was never pushed or advertised by the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Instead as Atari had promised, they made sure that a new version of TOS/GEM
would run on the TT030's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, other companies
saw the Atari platform as a viable and useful system for their flavors
of Unix, so LINUX a Unix clone was made for the Atari's and so was BSD/ATARI
Unix as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those individuals who had had the
chance to experience the power of Unix on their ST's have joined the ranks
of many other in enjoying such a powerful and versital operating system.</font>
