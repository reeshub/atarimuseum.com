<p>The Atari 260ST, a 256K version of the Atari 520ST released in the US
in full production
<br>by the summer of 1985.&nbsp; (User groups, dealers and press received
pre-release versions of
<br>the Atari 520ST's in April of 1985... some also had RF modulators installed.)
<p>The 260ST was designed for the European market, allowing consumers a
lower cost
<br>version that they could afford.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost of computers
in the UK &amp; Europe were much
<br>higher then in the US and a version of the Atari ST with 256K of memory
to reduce
<br>costs would help Atari penetrate the vast consumer bases oversea's.
<p>Released in 1986 this particular system was short lived as its cost
may have been lower
<br>due to its reduced memory size, so was its usefulness as most useful
software had
<br>no room to run with so little memory.</center>
