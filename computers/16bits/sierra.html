This is still as yet unconfirmed, but what you may be looking at above
is the concept case for the Atari "Sierra 68000" Project or the Gaza Project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari was already looking into the possibilities of a new high end computer
system based around the Motorola 68000 CPU and utilitizing a new chipset
being designed by at the Sunnyvale Advanced Research Center in California.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The chipset was called "Silver &amp; Gold".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another system
even more impressive then Sierra was GAZA, a MC68000 multiprocessor based
graphics system was also designed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a chipset called Rainbow,
several prototypes of the GAZA system had been completed and had 2 MC68000's
working together using CP/M-68K.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally Warner
management took a liking to the project, but later on felt it conflicted
with Atari's overall purpose of being an entertainment company so the plug
was pulled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Tramiels arrived, they had no idea
that completed prototypes of what may very have been systems far superior
to the ST's and the Amiga's were already completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
GAZA staff was fired, two of the engineers went onto to Digital Research,
Inc.</font></font>

The case design may look familiar to some.&nbsp;&nbsp; It very closely
resembles the Apple /// computer, except the Sierra sports two 3.5" diskette
drives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional photo's will follow in the comming
weeks and hopefully more data will follow as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Photo was
taken in November 1983.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom Palecki of Atari's Industrial
Design group graciously donated the above photo's and the slides which
will be coverted into photo's.</font></font>
