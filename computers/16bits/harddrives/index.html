<p align="left"><font face="Arial">When Atari first introduced its Atari ST 
computer line, it also shortly there after released a hard drive for your 
computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was called the SH204.&nbsp; SH standing for <b>S</b>T 
Line <b>H</b>ard disk and 204 for a 20MB storage unit.&nbsp; As for the &quot;4&quot; 
designation, it is unknown.&nbsp; Perhaps it was version 4 of the design. In 
1987 when Atari released its new Mega ST series.&nbsp; I new line of its ST 
computers in more professional pizza-box sized cases with detachable keyboards 
it also introduced its new Megafile line of storage systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before 
the new design would received its &quot;Megafile&quot; label, Atari began to produce its 
follow up to the SH204 called the SH205.&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially a Megafile 20 
with the early badge designator.</font></blockquote>

          the Desktop publishing field of which the Mega ST, the Megafile and 
          the new SLM804 Laser printer would consist of.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
          Trifecta created a low cost, but equally capable Desktop Publishing 
          system by Atari that would rival the Macintosh, all for less than the 
          cost of an Apple Laserwriter alone.</font></blockquote>

time) 440mbs of storage.</font></blockquote>

        <blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The true unsung hero of the Atari ST line and 
its Megafile's was its advanced interface system called ASCI which stood for 
Atari Small Computer Interface.&nbsp; It was a variant of the SCSI port standard 
and shares many of the same command functions. ASCI was less expensive, and 
slower than SCSI at around an average of 1300 KB/sec (1.3MB/sec) transfer speed.&nbsp; 
SCSI being much faster.&nbsp; However, this didn't make ASCI any less capable 
than SCSI.&nbsp;&nbsp; the ASCI port, or Atari DMA port could connect Mass 
Storage (Hard Drives and CDROM drives) as well as be used for high speed Laser 
Printers. Another not so well known feature and advantage of ASCI over SCSI was 
it was a self assigning connection Bus.&nbsp; SCSI required its host controller 
to be set to 7 and then each device set to a device number of 0 to 6 (Original 
SCSI 1 and 2 standard.)&nbsp; However with ASCI, it would auto assign device 
numbers allowing an ST user to simply plug in a device and prepare it for use, 
no complicated manuals, fumbling with setting switches or other issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Also ASCI was self-terminating. No it didn't self-destruct on command :-)&nbsp; 
In SCSI, the last device had to have a SCSI terminator installed onto it to show 
it was the last device on the bus, otherwise the SCSI devices would not be 
recognized nor work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some later SCSI devices had built in 
termination, but it had to be manually enabled.&nbsp; ASCI devices could simply 
be plugged in and would be ready for use.</font></blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In hindsight, it is a shame that Atari didn't 
produce and market an ISA bus compatible ASCI controller to sell into the PC 
market to allow PC users to have taken advantage of Atari's lower cost, feature 
capable storage and printing peripherals to further expand Atari's user base and 
put Atari's name and brand out into the broader market.&nbsp; This might've 
further cemented the ASCI standard into more area's making it adapted by more 
companies which in turn would've produced other storage and printing devices 
that would have also worked on ST computer systems.</font><blockquote>
