The Atari 260STfm was originally introduced in the United States but was
instead sold in the European market in limited numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
smaller amount of RAM meant a lower price for consumers in European countries
on a tight budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 256K or RAM, built in 720K floppy
drive (f designator) and a built in RF Modulator for us on standard Television
sets (m designator) allowed further acceptance for those who could not
purchase a monitor but instead opted to use an already existing television
set in the home.</font>

needed, the system was completely self contained.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The 260STfm was originally going to be
called the Atari 260STD, however a quick</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">review of the acronym revealed that STD
would not be a wise choice.</font>
