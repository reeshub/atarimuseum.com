Atari's first portable version of the Atari ST line of computers, the STacy
gave Atari users the freedom to carry (ok, lug...) their work with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although monsterous by todays 2.6lb to 5lb average laptop weight, the STacy
was loaded with a lot of features.&nbsp;&nbsp; One important feature was
its built-in MIDI ports.&nbsp;&nbsp; The STacy became the musicians choice
of computers because of its size and features.</font>
