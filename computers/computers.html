<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD"><b>In</b> the Summer of 1977 the 
team that had finished the Atari VCS was now hard at work on ways to make the 
&quot;STELLA&quot; chip more capable and to give the Atari VCS more features like the 
ability to display characters on the screen, have possibly some kind of keyboard 
and better graphics.&nbsp;What started out as making a new generation video game 
system to replace the 2600 would instead turn into a whole new Computer 
Division.&nbsp; Making computer systems was the next logical step for the 
company, however the home computers never actually started out as home computers 
in the beginning.&nbsp; They were supposed to be a better video game system and 
as the designs evolved - more memory, better graphics, DMA, I/O systems, 
keyboard and a design that would have actually had a built in monitor.&nbsp; The 
game systems turned into full blown computers.&nbsp; Well, that is to say at 
least one design - Colleen was a full blown computer.&nbsp; Candy, her little 
sister was still in debate as to whether she should be just a game only system 
with no I/O port and no Keyboard or to have them.&nbsp; Just before the deadline 
approached for Atari to show off its new systems for the Winter CES in January 
of 1979 the decision was made - Candy would be an entry level computer.&nbsp; 
Atari would not have a new video game system to replace the Stella.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#E9D7AD">Upon reflection, one could wonder if this was 
Atari's worst decision.&nbsp; After all the idea of a better &quot;STELLA&quot; - Atari 
VCS was the whole reason for the work started in 1977, to have a replacement for 
the Atari VCS when its expected end of life would be reached around 1980.&nbsp; 
The Candy could've been the replacement for the Atari VCS in 1980&nbsp; in a 
case with no keyboard and no SIO port and would've been Atari's next game 
system.&nbsp; Applications and serious programs could've been for the Atari 800, 
while the Atari 400 would've gotten a different name - perhaps it would've been 
the Atari Advanced Game System or something similar, it would've gotten all of 
the games written for it.&nbsp; Imagine a 1979 release of Space Invaders on it 
instead of the Atari 2600, or Pac Man on it instead of the Atari 2600.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Educational games would've been far better for parents buying a game console for 
their kids. Intellivision would've never stood a chance against Atari's new 
super game console released in 1979 and by 1980 the Atari VCS could've started 
to be phased out.&nbsp; So looking back, this may have been Atari's biggest 
mistake of them all and may have been what turned Atari onto the path of its 
demise by 1984.</font></p>

<b><font face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">The Birth of Candy &amp; Colleen:</font></b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">Back to Atari's 400/800 Computer 
release - Atari's HCD (Home Computer Division) engineers &amp; designers had 
designed the worlds first truly consumer based personal computers to use custom 
IC's to handle graphics, sound and communication. Atari's first two computers 
were called the Atari 400 and Atari 800 Personal Computer Systems.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">These computers 
had a large assortment of &quot;Intelligent&quot; peripherals which communicated through a 
custom bus called the &quot;SIO&quot; (Serial I/O) which compared to today standards is a 
rather simplistic version of the USB (Universal Serial Bus).&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact 
the USB and the Atari SIO have a lot more in common then many would think.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
One of Atari's original computer engineers, Joe Decuir who created the Atari SIO 
bus is also one of the team of engineers at Microsoft to help design and holds 
patents on the USB. </font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<b><font face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">The Birth of the XL's</font></b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#E9D7AD">First the Atari 1200XL would be introduced in Dec 
1982, followed in the summer of 1983 by the 600XL, and 800XL.&nbsp; The 800XL 
would be the low cost replacement for the 1200XL, it would be cancedl in July of 
1983.&nbsp; Other more high end computers:&nbsp; the 1400XL and the 1450XLD were 
slated to be released at the end of 1983.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">In the works in 1983, Atari had 
several new high-end computers including one called the 1600XL (Project Shakti) 
which would be a dual processor system with 6502 and 80186 for IBM 
compatibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another System called &quot;Sierra&quot; with a high-end 
audio/video chipset based on the MC68000 or 32016 or 286 processors but never got out of the 
design committee process.&nbsp; However in Corporate Research, the work on its 
high end video and audio chipsets was nearly completed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet another project in the works was another system 
called &quot;Gaza&quot; which also used a  MC68000 processor amd 2 other 
dedicated processors for I/O and Display (of up to 1k x 1k resolution), was 
demonstrated to the Warner Board but canned because they didn't want Atari 
competing in the business market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These systems would never 
make it past prototyping as Atari would be sold on July 2, 1984.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<b><font face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">The New Atari:</font></b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">On July 2, 1984 Atari's Consumer 
Electronics Division and its Home Computer Division were sold to Tramel 
Technologies Limited and the company was renamed Atari Corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard 
Tramiel adds: &quot;Our name Tramiel was constantly being mispronounced as &quot;Tra-meal&quot; 
and my dad hoped that the other spelling would get people to say &quot;Tra-mell&quot; (it 
rhymes with &quot;done well&quot;). It didn't work.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">The Atari XL line of computers was 
cancelled with its last version - the 800XLF released in Europe in August of 
1984 and in 1985 a new line of computers to replace the XL line called the Atari 
65XE and 130XE computers were introduced.&nbsp;&nbsp; The original internal name 
of the 65XE was the 900XLF.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">Atari also introduced an all new 
line of computers called the Atari ST line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These new 
computers would use the Motorola 68000 processor, come with 512K of memory, use 
3.5&quot; disk drives, RGB monitors and a graphics user environment based on CP/M 68K 
and Digital Research GEM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally the processor for this 
new line of computers was to be the National 32016, however its speed and its 
availability was in doubt, so the MC68000 was chosen. Amazingly, the Atari 
engineers were 
able to go from Shiraz Shivji's concept from May 1984 to a working demonstration 
system at the January 1985 Winter CES.&nbsp; A mere 5 months.&nbsp; By June of 
1985 developers and User Groups received advanced release units and by September 
1985 the first Atari 520ST computers began to show up on retail shelves.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">Atari would, over the course of 8 
years improve upon its ST line of computers with such lines as the Mega ST, STe, 
Mega STe, TT030 and Falcon030 line of computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari also 
introduced a laptop called the STacy and had in the works an under 5 lb. laptop 
called the STBook as its replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pen based touch tablet 
version of the ST called the STpad or &quot;STylus&quot; had been shown in prototype form 
but was never sold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari introduced an assortment of 
peripherals from disk drives to very low cost and feature rich laser printers 
for its line of ST computers.
</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#E9D7AD">Taking a step back, in 
1987 Atari introduced a line of IBM compatible computer systems starting with 
its Atari PC-1 which was an all-in-one IBM XT compatible computer with built in 
disk drive, built in serial, parallel, keyboard, mouse and video ports (video 
could be configured for CGA, Hercules, EGA and other settings).&nbsp;&nbsp; An 
internal bus port on the motherboard allowed for an expansion card to use the 
Atari Mega ST &quot;Megafile&quot; hard disk system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari also 
introduced other PC compatible systems as well as a 386sx laptop and also an IBM 
XT palmtop computer the size of a VHS video tape. </font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">The Atari Falcon030 was Atari last 
computer system to be produced.&nbsp;&nbsp; All company resources were directed 
towards the creation and completion of Atari's 64-bit Interactive Multimedia 
System called the Atari Jaguar 64 which was sold in 1993. </font></p>
