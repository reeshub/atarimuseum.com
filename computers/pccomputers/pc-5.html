&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari was not doing well at
all in the PC compatible field with its existing line of compatibles.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The problem was stemming from the fact that the PC's were custom built
by Atari and were actually too well made and in turn, were too costly.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari had to compete against Grey Market PC's makers who were selling PC's
for far less than Atari could possible sell theirs for.&nbsp;&nbsp; So
Atari decided, if you can't beat'em, join'em.&nbsp;&nbsp; They started
selling PC's with generic motherboards in them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC-5 was
a 386sx 16mhz system with 5.25" floppy drive, internal 40 MB Seagate ST225
MFM hard disk, Parallel/Serial card and basic 256K VGA adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This system was not quite as nicely built as the PC-1 or any of Atari's
ABC (Atari Basic Computer) computer systems, but it was cheaper to make
and sell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, its quite interesting but Atari mentioned
in several of its ads that their PC-4 and PC-5 systems were capable of
running OS/2 v1.2
