<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari originally
considered an IBM compatible system in 1983 and began work on a project
called the Atari 1650XLD, according to Joe Miller, one of the engineers
who built the prototypes "it was a system which was to combine an Atari
6502 based computer with an Intel 80186 CPU chip and using special software
written both in-house and by Microsoft would allow the system to work in
6502 mode or switch to MS-DOS mode and use the same video circuitry."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1987
Atari Corp decided to try and enter the IBM PC compatible clone market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There systems were varied from an IBM XT clone up to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a 386SX/DX clone and even a 386SX laptop
computer (which was actually nothing more then an Epson/Sotec laptop in
Atari clothing.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">failed to advertise properly, to get enough
coverage and to strike up deals with dealers for counter space for demo
systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people never knew Atari ever made desktop PC
systems and a laptop system.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only PC compatible system
that was noticed was the Atari Portfolio palmtop.</font>
