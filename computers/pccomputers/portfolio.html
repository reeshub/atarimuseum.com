&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari entered into the consumer
palmtop market with an innovative product call The Portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This computer was an IBM XT about the size of VHS video cassette at about
3/4's the height.&nbsp;&nbsp; It had an PC Card expansion slot (Not PCMCIA
compatible, that spec didn't exist formal for a few more years).&nbsp;&nbsp;
It came packages with MS-DOS 2.2 compatibility, Lotus 1-2-3 compatible
spreadsheet, a simple text processor, phone book with auto-dialing through
a built-in speaker, calendar and todo list.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="portfolio2.JPG" HEIGHT=173 WIDTH=144 ALIGN=RIGHT>The
Portfolio had a strong following with several companies introducing software
cards, hard drives and floppy drives for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari also had
a PC Card drive for IBM computers to allow a user the ability to write
to a PC and then remove it from the PC Card Drive connected to a PC and
then slide the card into the Portfolio and the system could read the PC
Card as a disk drive letter and access all the data.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In todays market with US Robotics PalmPilots and
HP 320LX palmtops which are all the rage, Atari probably could have faired
well with an more updated version of their Personal Organizer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It may have been a matter that Atari introduced an excellent product at
the wrong time to a market they may not have been quite ready for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Portfolio is still widely used and still quite popular in many circles
with numerous sites supporting it with system updates and software.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hardware and accessories are still available from several vendors.
