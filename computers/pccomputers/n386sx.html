&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari sold a PC latop computer
as part of their ABC (Atari Basic Computer) line.&nbsp;&nbsp; The laptop
was nothing more then a SOTEC laptop (A Japanese company)&nbsp; in Atari
clothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; However Atari made a nice choice in laptops to sell.&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Note the STacy'ish look of the laptop.) The N386SX wasn't terribly heavy,
had parallel/serial/VGA and PS/2 mouse ports, internal 3.5" disk drive
and 40 mb internal hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The system only comes with 1MB
of memory, but an expansion slot on the top of the system allowed for a
2 or 4 MB memory upgrade and coprocessor upgrade.&nbsp; Also another slot
was available for an internal modem card as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The system
came with an Atari version of the ever popular MS-DOS 5.0 on the hard drive
as well as a diskette which contain a CMOS configuration utility.&nbsp;&nbsp;
(For those interested in owning on of these Laptops, <A HREF="http://www.myatari.com">B&amp;C
Atari Sales &amp; Service</A> has several available for sale.)
