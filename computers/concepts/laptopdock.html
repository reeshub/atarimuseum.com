<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, based on the Alan
Kay "Databook" concept and also looking nearly identical to what Radio
would release several years later as the Model 100 computer, this Atari
Laptop concept is striking in form and functionality and would have been
applaudingly accepted by the computer community had it been released in
1984 sometime.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more interesting aspect
to this laptop concept is its concept of being able to come home or to
the office and then "Docking" the laptop to an expansion box with built
in disk drive and printer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today many laptops are touted as
having available such options, but to suggest such an idea back in 1983
is groundbreaking in thought and design.
