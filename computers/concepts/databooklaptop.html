<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspired from Alan Kay's
idea of a "Databook" (Alan Kay formerly of Xerox PARC, was Atari's chief
scientist and headed up many advanced R&amp;D projects for Atari until
leaving for Apple Computer to assist in the development of the Apple Macintosh),
a computer that could be carried around with you that would be the size
of a notebook, the Atari "Databook" styled laptop meets those specifications
exactly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Giving the user a full keyboard, plus numeric keypad,
LCD screen and in some models, even a microcassette datastorage drive.&nbsp;
Different styles and keyboard types were examined.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These concepts truly show
what a laptop could and should be like in form and functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Several years later, one of the first laptops to be introduced with a strikingly
similar look to the Atari "Databook" styled laptop was Tandy's Radio Shack
Model 100 computer.
