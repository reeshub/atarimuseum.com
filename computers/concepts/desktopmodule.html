This first concept was almost built.&nbsp;&nbsp; This desktop system was
in modules which would be plugged into one another to supply a different
function.&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting with a power module, then add the CPU module
which sports an advanced LCD display screen, two front joystick ports.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then add on a top loading 3.5" diskette drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next add in
a unique, almost Canon Inkjet functioning thermal printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now finish the system off with an IBM "Peanut" PCjr'ish Infrared wireless
keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; This system packed in the latest and great in state
of the art technology which today would make fellow PC owners jealous.</font>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This second drawing which
is similar to the above shows the configuration with a slightly different
chasis shape and although the keyboard is not shown with a cord, this configure
makes no mention or suggestion of an Infrared wireless keyboard.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are additional design
styles along these same lines and concepts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept design
to the center-right is quite stunning and very high-tech and forward thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Again, these designs even in today's PC market are eye-catching and very
stylish.
