<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">In Atari's early days, one of the 
video game designers and his rather odd friend worked many late nights on a new 
arcade game called &quot;Breakout&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; While working on this new video game 
and playing other arcade games all through the night these two friends were busy 
on the side designing and building (from &quot;borrowed&quot; Atari parts) a personal 
computer system.&nbsp;&nbsp; They approached Nolan Bushnell with their new 
creation to see if it would be a product that Atari would sell and support.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">At the time Atari was 
concentrating on getting its new home version of Pong out the door and all 
resources were tied up, with no spare capital to devout to such a costly and 
risky product, Nolan Bushnell referred the two budding entrepreneurs to some 
venture capitalists to finance their new product.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was this former Atari 
employee?&nbsp;&nbsp; None other then the current iCEO of Apple, Steve Jobs.&nbsp; Who was his 
rather odd friend?&nbsp; Steve &quot;The Woz&quot; Wozniak and their creation was the Apple 
Computer. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">In 1978 the team that had finished the Atari VCS was 
at work on a new high-end video game console chipset.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari was now owned by 
Warner Communications since its sale in 1976 by its original owner/creator Nolan 
Bushnell for $28 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari was now run by Raymond Kassar who wanted 
Atari to compete in the home computer market against Apple and its Apple ][e 
computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new high-end chipset was &quot;frozen&quot; for use only in the newly 
created Atari Home Computer Division. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">Atari's new Home Computer Division was so hastily 
started that office trailers were brought in and set-up behind Atari's offices 
while work progressed on the new computer designs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Working in these rather 
cramped quarters Atari's new HCD engineers &amp; designers went to work on designing 
the worlds first personal computers to use custom IC's to handle graphics, sound 
and communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari's first two computers were called the Atari 400 and 
Atari 800 Personal Computer Systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These computers had a large assortment 
of &quot;Intelligent&quot; peripherals which communicated through a custom bus called the 
&quot;SIO&quot; (Serial I/O) which compared to today standards is a rather simplistic 
version of the USB (Universal Serial Bus).&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact the USB and the Atari SIO 
have a lot more in common then many would think.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of Atari's original 
computer engineers, Joe Decuir who created the Atari SIO bus is also one of the 
team of engineers at Microsoft to help design and holds patents on the USB.
</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">The Atari 400/800 line was cancelled in 1982 to be 
replaced by a new sleek high-tech looking computer called the Atari 1200XL.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The computer had an incompatible OS, no external expansion bus and little 
enhancements over the original 400/800 line and due to these shortcomings, the 
sales of the Atari 800 computer increased while people rushed to buy them before 
supplies ran out.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1200XL was quickly replaced by the Atari 600/800XL line 
of computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These computers fixed many of the 1200XL's shortcomings, had a 
Parallel Bus Interface for external expansion options.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several other computers 
were planned with voice synthesizers, built-in modems and built in disk drives 
but were never officially sold. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">In the works in 1983, Atari had several new high-end 
computers including one called the 1600XL which would be a dual processor system 
with 6502 and 80186 for IBM compatibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another System called &quot;Sierra&quot; with 
a high-end audio/video chipset based on the MC68000 processor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet another 
project in the works was another system called &quot;Gaza&quot; which also used a high-end 
chipset and MC68000 processor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These systems would never make it past 
prototyping as Atari would be sold in 1984. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">On July 2, 1984 Atari's Consumer Electronics 
Division and its Home Computer Division were sold to Tramiel Technologies 
Limited and the company was renamed Atari Corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari XL line of 
computers was cancelled and in 1985 a new line of computers to replace the XL 
line called the Atari 65XE and 130XE computers were introduced. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">Atari also introduced an all new line of computers 
called the Atari ST line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These new computers would use the Motorola 68000 
processor, come with 512K of memory, use 3.5&quot; disk drives, RGB monitors and a 
graphics user environment based on CP/M 68K and Digital Research GEM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Originally the processor for this new line of computers was to be the National 
32032, however its availability was in doubt, so the MC68000 was chosen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">Atari would, over the course of 8 years improve upon 
its ST line of computers with such lines as the Mega ST, STe, Mega STe, TT030 
and Falcon030 line of computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari also introduced a laptop called the 
STacy and had in the works an under 5 lb. laptop called the STBook as its 
replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pen based touch tablet version of the ST had been shown in 
prototype form but was never sold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari introduced an assortment of 
peripherals from disk drives to laser printers for its line of ST computers.
</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">In 1987 Atari introduced a line of IBM compatible 
computer systems starting with its Atari PC-1 which was an all-in-one IBM XT 
compatible computer with built in disk drive, built in serial, parallel, 
keyboard, mouse and video ports (video could be configured for CGA, Hercules, 
EGA and other settings).&nbsp;&nbsp; An internal bus port on the motherboard allowed for 
an expansion card to use the Atari Mega ST &quot;Megafile&quot; hard disk system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari 
also introduced other PC compatible systems as well as a 386sx laptop and also 
an IBM XT palmtop computer the size of a VHS video tape. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#E9D7AD">The Atari Falcon030 was Atari last computer system 
to be produced.&nbsp;&nbsp; All company resources were directed towards the creation and 
completion of Atari's 64-bit Interactive Multimedia System called the Atari 
Jaguar 64 which was sold in 1993. </font></p>
