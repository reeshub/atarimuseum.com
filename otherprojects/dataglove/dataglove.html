Atari, founded by University of Utah graduate Nolan Bushnell, was once
the fastest growing company in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp; Started in 1972 with
an initial investment of $500, Atari attained sales exceeding $500 million
in 1980.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the late 1970's and early 1980's, it was a
center for exciting developments in software and chip design for home entertainment
products.&nbsp; A joint venture with LucasFilm in 1982, in which Atari
licensed and manufactured games designed by LucasFilm, established cross-pollination
between video games and film studios.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Several pioneering figures in the VF field got their start at Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Warren Robinett, who had directed the head-mounted display and nanomanipulator
project at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, developed the
popular video game ADVENTURE at Atari in the late 1970's.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jaron
Lanier, creator of the video game Moondust, used the profits to launch
VPL-Research in 1984, the first commercial VR company.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1980,
Atari created its own research center, directed by Alan Kay, who came from
Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and assembled a team of the best and brightest
in interface design and VR research, the DataGlove was one such product.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But Atari fell on hard times.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long after its banner year
in 1980, it registered $536 million in losses for 1983.&nbsp; The Atari
Research Laboratory was a casualty of the economic crash in the video game
industry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the people working in VR at Atari either
migrated to work on VR projects in federal laboratories, or, like Lanier,
persured government contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lanier eventually won a contract
to build the DataGlove for NASA.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Industry was clearly not prepared, after sustaining such a big economic
blow, to continue development of VR technology own its own.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indeed Lanier's failed efforts to market a consumer entertainment version
of the DataGlove, called PowerGlove, for Nintendo, demonstrated that the
1980's was not the right time for a sustained industry push of this type
of technology.</font></font>
