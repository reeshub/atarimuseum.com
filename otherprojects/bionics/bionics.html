Atari Bionics System.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An entirely new product designed
for the medical field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system was comprised of an
expandable base unit which would have various plug-in modules which would
perform a specific function such as check heart rate and blood pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Other modules would perform other tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hewlett
Packard makes medical equipment and many of their products have the same
design characteristics as those shown here in the Atari Bionics system.</font></font>

the unit has an Atari VCS type cartridge connection on the side, it was
not intended for Atari cartridges.&nbsp; The connector was meant for a
plug in connector which would allow a system of cables for monitors and
other interfaces to connect to the Bionics base module.&nbsp;&nbsp; In
some of the concept drawings, an Atari VCS is actually connected into the
Bionics System.</font></font></div>

modules would each plug into the base unit to perform specific functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unit module design actually became a new game controller product.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The original design of the module was to measure resistance in the muscles
of a person.&nbsp;&nbsp; This concept became a new game controller called
the Mindlink System.&nbsp;&nbsp; A combination of headband and infrared
transceivers would allow a user to control the action on the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One software product was called Bionic Breakthrough.</font></font>
