Alan Kay, a scientist from Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) where
the first Personal Computer was invented and the first graphics operating
system was designed (The Xerox STAR 8010 was where Steve Jobs got the idea
for the Macintosh and the Macintosh is where Bill Gates got the idea for
Windows) came to Atari as Atari's chief scientist to explore the idea's
of what people would be doing with video games and computers in not 2 or
3 years but in 7 to 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many projects were started
and many products were created, none were used for actually consumer products
but more for research.&nbsp;&nbsp; A high end chipset called "Silver &amp;
Gold" was created, one chip in particular was called AMY, when Atari, Inc.
was sold to the Tramiels, they attempted to get the AMY music chip to work
in an Atari 65XE.&nbsp;&nbsp; The chip was said to have unbelievable sound,
octaves, and voices.&nbsp;&nbsp; One demo has it playing an opera singer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Without Atari's R&amp;D personnel to decipher its true workings the Tramiels
were never able to get AMY working and the 65XE-M was never brought to
market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope as time goes by to show other items
from the LA Lab.</font>

Atari users have always wished for and wanted to join the ranks of other
computers like the Apple and IBM in the networking arena.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Apple with its Appletalk network and IBM's with a plethora of networks
from Arcnet to Token Ring to Ethernet and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari's
while powerful, versatile and flexible, never seemed to jump into the networking
bandwagon with the exception of the use of ribbon cable interface boxes
connected to MUX's into Corvus Hard Drives to share data.&nbsp;&nbsp; Corvus
would later introduce its Omni-net network, alas the Atari computers were
not to join in on its innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CSS (Computer
Software Services) around 89-90 introduced its MUX network, a group of
cartridges that with ribbon cables would allow one Atari 8bit computer
to be a master and the others to be slaves that could access its disk drives
and printer, while not as fancy as other networks, it did the job.</font>

It turns out, that during the years of Atari's Corporate Research, around
1983 networking did come to Atari's in the form of "ALAN-K".&nbsp;&nbsp;
Playing on the name of Alan Kay,&nbsp; Atari's Chief Scientist and head
of Atari's Advanced Research Labs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These labs were spread
all over the country:&nbsp; Sunnyvale, Ca.&nbsp;&nbsp; Los Angeles, Ca.&nbsp;
New York City, Cambridge, Ma.&nbsp; ALAN-K was born....</font>

ALAN-K stood for <b>A</b>tari <b>L</b>ocal <b>A</b>rea <b>N</b>etwork,
Model<b>-K</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was made up of modules
inside of standard Atari 850 plastic cases and equipped with 2 SIO connectors
and on the back 2 - 9 pin female connectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According
to Rob Newman, former Corporate Researcher "The network was setup in a
circle, similar to Token Ring".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each module had a 8 switch
setting to set the address of the module.</font>

The modules have an onboard Eprom with code on it, however unlike the 850
interfaces, these modules do not appear to autoload, so examining the functionality
of them is not possible at this time until a boot disk with the needed
software to boot the ALAN's is located.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari
History Museum has 2 of these interfaces in its archives and it is hoped
to one day have them working again to show at one of the public Classic
Computing Shows.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dumps of the ROM's have been made available
below, they appear to be slightly different from one another, CRC's are
included.</font>

The ALAN-K network was fully deployed at one site, at the Club Med resort
in Mexico where kiosks were setup around the resort for people to communicate
with one another, look up events and other information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari's Corporate Research team was dispatched down to the resort to install
the network, below is an actual recount of the event that took place and
the trials and tribulations that followed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corporate
Research did approach Atari's Marketing Department with the idea of commercially
selling the Network Modules, however the idea was turned down as too much
time and effort would have had to be put into selling the product and Marketing
wanting products that could instantly generate revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp; So
unfortunately another product designed within Atari, well ahead of its
time that would've once again shown the world how powerful and versatile
Atari computers were was quietly kept in-house and out of the public's
reach.</font>
