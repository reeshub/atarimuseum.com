<p>Q: Previous maintainers.
<p>A: A. Karl Heller (heller@cdnow.com) maintained the 2600 FAQ up to version
<br>11, and co-maintained it up to and including version 11.5. The classic
<br>community owes him a large debt of gratitude for his efforts.
<p>Karl also deserves high praise for graciously stepping aside when his
<br>interest in maintaining this FAQ waned. Karl allowed me to improve
his
<br>creation (starting with version 11) without becoming angry or possessive.
I
<br>sincerely hope that I am as gracious as he when it is my turn to pass
this
<br>FAQ on to someone else.

you a
<br>proper attribution and a thank-you, please email us.
<p>Q: What information is missing from the FAQ?
<p>A: Bunches of stuff, some of which includes:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * confirmation of baud rate for Gameline modem
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * 7800 encryption code (ha ha)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Any link found in the dead links file
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~dzubera/2600deadlinks.html).
These links
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worked in previous versions of the FAQ, but
have been relegated to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dead links file until I can find out where
they went.
<p>Q: Where can I find the latest version of this FAQ?
<p>A: The FAQ (http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~dzubera/2600faq.html) is maintained
<br>in html form and is amended as updates come in. Every so often (when
there
<br>is enough new material), the html version is converted to text, edited
a
<br>bit, and posted to rec.games.video.classic, rec.games.video.atari,
<br>rec.answers and news.answers. The text version
<br>(http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~dzubera/2600faq.txt) is on the Web as
well,
<br>but it is updated only before posting to Usenet.
<p>Q: What Usenet groups discuss or are relevant to the 2600/7800?
<p>A: There are several groups:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * rec.games.video.classic
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * rec.games.video.marketplace
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * rec.games.video.atari
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * alt.atari.2600
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * alt.atari.2600vcs
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * alt.atari.2600.programming
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * alt.atari.2600.vcs
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * alt.games.atari
<p>rec.games.video.classic (rgvc) is probably the best place to start,
as it is
<br>carried in most newsfeeds and generally has the most traffic.
<br>rec.games.video.marketplace is for the buying and selling of video
games and
<br>systems and is not limited to atari or even classic systems. It is
dominated
<br>by post-classic ads, which is why you will often see buy/sell/auction
posts
<br>in rgvc. rec.games.video.atari usually contains Jaguar discussion,
but will
<br>occasionally digress into 2600/7800 discussion when it pertains to
the
<br>Jaguar (e.g. Tempest 2000). The five atari alt groups are not carried
by
<br>many newsfeeds; consequently, the traffic in these groups is minimal.
<p>Do not post to alt.2600 or any of its subgroups about the Atari 2600/7800.
<br>That group is for discussion of hacking and phreaking and you will
probably
<br>get flamed if you do.
<p>If you don't have a newsfeed at your site, but do have a newsreader
(most
<br>web browsers have one built in), you can still get access to some,
if not
<br>all of these groups. See the List of Open NNTP servers
<br>(http://oloon.student.utwente.nl/open_nntp.html) page for a list of
places
<br>where you might point your browser to see the rgvc groups.
<p>Many of these servers have only a limited number of groups, so if the
one
<br>you choose doesn't carry rgvc, try another. Another possible solution
is
<br>newsone.net (http://newsone.net), which does carry all of the 2600
related
<br>news groups. Make sure you use the "frames mode," or you'll get a new
<br>browser window for each news article.
<p>Maintainer's note: www.feedme.org used to be recommended, but disappeared
<br>without a trace.
<p>Q: What is the rec.games.video.classic charter?
<p>A: We have uncovered the following:
<p>rec.games.video.classic is an unmoderated newsgroup which passed its
<br>vote for creation by 257:85 as reported in news.announce.newgroups
on
<br>13 Apr 1993.
<p>And from the second Call for Votes
<br>(ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/news.announce.newgroups/rec/rec.games.video-reorg),
<p>these bits:
<p>5) Should a newsgroup rec.games.video.classic be created?
<p>This newsgroup would carry discussions regarding older, "classic" home
<br>video entertainment systems like the Atari 2600, Coleco, Intellivision,
<br>etc.&nbsp; This newsgroup would supersede alt.games.video.classic.
<p>Finally, for those of you wondering if buy/sell/auction posts are
<br>discouraged on groups other than rec.games.video.marketplace, consider
the
<br>following:
<p>3) Should a newsgroup rec.games.video.marketplace be created?
<p>This newsgroup would carry offers to sell and requests to buy home video
<br>entertainment products and accessories like systems, cartridges, etc.
<p>The netiquette of the rec.games.video.* hierarchy would request that
<br>people NOT cross-post buy/sell discussions to other rec.games.video.*
<br>newsgroups.
<p>Q: Are there any mailing lists that discuss the 2600/7800?
<p>A: There are at least three. Jeremy Wilson (xeno@inforamp.net) runs
the
<br>classic videogames mailing list, which covers both home and arcade
classic
<br>games. To subscribe, mail listserv@moose.to with the following message
body:
<p>subscribe classic-videogames your@email.address Your Name
<p>There is also a UK Classic Videogame mailing list; ian@planetbuilders.co.uk
<br>for subscribe requests, ccnuk@onelist.com for the list itself. For
more
<br>information, see this link (http://www.gyruss.demon.co.uk/ccnuk/).
The above
<br>page also contains a database of classic UK collectors. There is also
a
<br>separate UK list (ccnukfst@onelist.com) exclusively for sale and trade
<br>posts; ian@planetbuilders.co.uk for subscription requests to that list
as
<br>well.
<p>The Stella mailing list (also know as the Starpath CD mailing list and
the
<br>Atari 2600 Programming list) is for those using the Starpath CD development
<br>tools to write 2600 games. To subscribe, mail majordomo@biglist.com
with the
<br>following in the message body:
<p>subscribe stella your@email.address
<p>The informational snippet for this list is as follows.
<p>"This list was designed as as support group for Starpath CD owners who
are
<br>writing 2600 games through the developer software. It is hoped that
TOGETHER
<br>we can write some new games for the 2600. Exchanging uuencoded binaries
is
<br>okay as long as it's in BIN form, not WAV."
<p>Q: Where can I find cart lists?
<p>A: VGR (vgr@clark.net) maintains the giant 2600/7800 list which contains
<br>entries for most 2600/7800 games, although it has not been updated
in a
<br>while. In addition to manufacturer's model number, the list also includes
<br>rarity ratings. Here is the plain text version
<br>(http://www.clark.net/pub/vgr/lists/plain/atari) and the html table
version
<br>(http://www.clark.net/pub/vgr/lists/ht/atari/ataritoc.html).
<p>Dean Dierschow (dean@xocolatl.com) maintains game lists
<br>(http://www.xocolatl.com/carts/) for several systems including the
<br>2600/7800. The relevant files are at2600.lst, at5200.lst, and at7800.lst.
<br>These lists are a good starting point for the new or general game collector;
<br>alas, these files have not been updated since Oct 94.
<p>The Giant List of 2600 Label Variations is for all of the sick collectors
<br>who want to know label differences in excruciating detail. John Earney
<br>(jearney@best.com) maintains the list
<br>(http://www.best.com/~jearney/lists/labelsv5.txt), which looks like
this:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cosmic Ark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
IA3204
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silver label with no picture,
"for use with..." in 5 languages
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silver label with picture

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silver label with picture
720104-1 Rev A.&nbsp; right edge of picture
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is in the middle of 1982.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ??? silver label with no

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boxed: silver box (c)1982
<p>Digital Press (digitpre@ix.netcom.com) markets its Classic Video Games
<br>Collector's Guide which covers the Atari 2600/7800 and many other classic
<br>and neo-classic systems. Now in its fifth edition, it contains a wealth
of
<br>information for the reasonable price of $20 ($30 outside of the US
and
<br>Canada). See the CVGCG home page (http://www.digitpress.com/dpg_plug.htm)
or
<br>send $20 (checks should be payable to Joe Santulli) to:
<p>Joe Santulli
<br>digital press
<br>44 hunter place
<br>pompton lakes, nj 07442
<p>The Digital Press Collector's Guide CDROM Companion is a nice complement
to
<br>DP's paper guide. It contains box, cart and handheld scans, screenshots,
<br>manuals, TV commercials, emulators and much more in a two-cd, not-for-profit
<br>set for only $12. See Sean Kelly's DP CDROM page
<br>(http://www.xnet.com/~skelly/dp-cd/dp-cd.htm) for the full story and
<br>ordering information.
<p>JerryG (JerryG@hevanet.com) also markets a cart guide called JerryG's
Guide
<br>to the Classic Video Games. It was available as a beta edition for
$15, but
<br>alas, is now sold out. He is currently working on a proper first edition.
<br>See the JGCVC home page
<br>(http://www.Atari2600.com/museum/guide/JerryGguide.html) for information
on
<br>the forthcoming first edition, tentatively scheduled for release on
December
<br>12, 1998.
<p>In addition, JerryG maintains a cart list
<br>(http://www.Atari2600.com/museum/2600/2600List.html) grouped by
<br>manufacturer. It currently lists 1543 titles.
<p>Leonard Herman (rolenta@aol.com) is the author of ABC's to the VCS ,
a
<br>low-cost ($8.00) book containing descriptions of nearly all VCS games.
See
<br>the Rolenta Press (http://www.rolentapress.com) home page for more
<br>information.
<p>Finally, Alexander Bilstein (bilstein@mail.utexas.edu) maintains a set
of
<br>cart lists
<br>(http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~bilstein/atari2600nexus/rarity/rarity.html)
on
<br>his web site. These lists are updated frequently, and thus are more
accurate
<br>than the VGR list.
<p>Q: What magazines cover the 2600/7800?
<p>A: The 2600 Connection is the premier bi-monthly Atari 2600 resource.
This
<br>fanzine, published by Russ Perry Jr. (slapdash@enteract.com), is an
<br>excellent source of information about Atari video game collecting in
<br>general, including news, game reviews, interviews, and entertaining
<br>anecdotes. [Ed note: Russ doesn't seem to be able to find the 2600
FAQ home
<br>site, though :) ] Rare and collectible games are frequently discussed.
<br>Classified ads in the Connection are relevant to all Atari game machines.
<br>Subscription price is $9 for a year's worth of bi-monthly issues (6)
or
<br>$1.50 for single copies.
<p>To subscribe send a check payable to Russ Perry Jr. to:
<p>The 2600 Connection
<br>c/o Russ Perry Jr.
<br>2175 S. Tonne Rd. #105
<br>Arlington Hts, IL&nbsp; 60005
<p>Back issues of the 2600 Connection are available from Tim Duarte
<br>(timdu@hotmail.com), the previous publisher for $1.50. There is also

<br>(http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Lair/9260).
<p>Digital Press (http://www.digitpress.com) also covers the 2600/7800,
but it
<br>is mixed with information about both neo-classic and modern systems.
Hard
<br>copy subscriptions are $10 for six bi-monthly issues. Back issues (#13-#40)
<br>are available for $2.25 each, issues #1-#12 are available as a set

<br>Contact Joe Santulli (digitpre@ix.netcom.com) for more information.
<p>Russ Perry Jr. (slapdash@enteract.com) also publishes Slap-Dash , an
<br>eclectic collection of video game information, personal opinion, references
<br>to beer and pictures of women bassists. Although a bit offbeat, it
does
<br>contain information about classic gaming not found anywhere else. For
<br>example, Issue 6 contains bits of information culled from conversations
of
<br>many Ex-atari employees. Send $1.50 for the latest issue (#6) to:
<p>Russ Perry Jr.
<br>2175 S. Tonne Rd. #105
<br>Arlington Hts, IL&nbsp; 60005
<p>Classic Gamer (http://www.classicgamer.com) by Chris Cavanaugh, covers
what
<br>you might expect. The first issue, now sold out, was $3 + $0.50 shipping.
<p>Also worth mentioning is Retrogaming Times
<br>(http://tomheroes.com/Video%20Games%20FS/Retrotimes/retrogam.htm),
a free
<br>'zine by Tom Zjaba, now in its 22nd issue.
<p>The January 1996 issue of Ultimate Gamer has an article called The Atari
<br>Quest which has both pictures and information about hardware and cartridge
<br>prototypes. Some topics include Mindlink, 2600 Tempest, Airworld, Looney
<br>Tunes Hotel, Microgammon SB, Meebzork, and Sport Goofy. For those of
you who
<br>weren't quick enough on the draw, Dennis Brown's Library
<br>(http://ns2.apmtech.com/dbrown/museum/texts) contains jpg's of the
article.
<p>Q: What magazines covered the 2600/7800 in the 80s?

<br>Home Videogames. It covers the home video game industry in detail from
the
<br>pre-classic days, through the early 80s and up to 1993. At $12.99,
it's a
<br>steal for the amount of information contained in it. The second edition
is
<br>available for $10 to first edition owners, $19.95 otherwise (plus $3
for
<br>priority shipping or $1.50 for 4th class shipping). See the Rolenta
Press
<br>(http://www.rolentapress.com) home page for more information.
<p>Another book is Zap! : the Rise and Fall of Atari by Scott Cohen. Here
is
<br>some information on this out-of-print book:
<p>&nbsp;AUTHOR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cohen, Scott.
<br>&nbsp;TITLE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zap] : the rise
and fall of Atari / Scott Cohen.
<br>&nbsp;PUBLISHER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New York : McGraw-Hill, c1984.
<br>&nbsp;DESCRIPTION&nbsp; xii, 177 p. ; 22 cm.
<br>&nbsp;SUBJECT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari, Inc. -- History.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Electronic games industry -- United States -- History.
<br>&nbsp;NOTE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Includes

<br>&nbsp;ISBN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0070115435.
<p>"The Macra Terror" makes the following observation:
<p>It's a good history of Atari itself, but somewhat lacking in perspective
<br>(competing game systems receive few mentions) and sometimes snide in
tone.
<br>It also covers the career of Nolan Bushnell, through the creation of
<br>PizzaTime (later Chuck E. Cheese) restaurants. It ends ironically in
the
<br>middle of 1983, with Atari execs talking about the great things ahead.
<p>Also note that searching for Zap! among stacks of books may not be that
<br>difficult. The copy I (Zube) have seen was a thin, hardback, blue-covered
<br>book with the title written in white down the entire length of the
spine.
<p>The November 1996 issue of Next Generation magazine has excerpts from
a
<br>forthcoming book by Steven L. Kent called (at the time) Electronic
Nation.
<br>It covers the roots of the video game industry, including bits from
people
<br>like Bushnell and Alcorn. Next Generation has printed several other
bits in
<br>other issues as well. CNN recently reported
<br>(http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9812/04/nintendo.zelda/index.html) that
<br>Kent's book is now called The First Quarter: The 25-Year History of
Video
<br>Games and is still forthcoming. None of the online bookstores have
any
<br>mention of it as yet.
<p>Halcyon Days: Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Game Programmers
is
<br>an electronic book (html format) available from Dadgum Games
<br>(http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon.html). A review of the book and several
<br>snippets from it can be found in Issue #42 of the 2600 Connection.
According
<br>to the review, only six of the twenty-eight programmers interviewed
worked
<br>on the 2600, so much information contained in the book is not directly
<br>relevant to the 2600 world. A short Halcyon Days FAQ
<br>(http://dadgum.com/hdays/halcyon-faq.html) is available from the publisher.
<p>For comprehensive list of related material, see the Classic Video Game
<br>Literature List (http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/cvg/cvglit.shtml),
<br>maintained by Lee K. Seitz.
<p>Q: Are there any videos that cover the 2600/7800?
<p>A: Once Upon Atari: The Agony and the Ecstasy is the fourth in a four
part
<br>series about the early days of Atari. Produced by Howard Scott Warshaw
<br>(hsw@netcom.com), the tape (supposedly) contains "technical info that
can
<br>only be appreciated by serious enthusiasts," including bits about the
<br>difficulty of programming the 2600 and "favorite games of the game
makers."
<br>At $29.95 ($25.95 + $4 shipping), it's a bit steep for its 28 minute
running
<br>time. Send your check or money order (made out to Scott West) to:
<p>Scott West Productions
<br>P.O. Box 610787
<br>San Jose, CA&nbsp; 95161
<p>and be sure to specify NTSC or PAL format. For all the details (and
on-line
<br>ordering) see HSW's Web Page (http://pw1.netcom.com/~hsw/ouatari.html).
Note
<br>that the other three parts of the series have yet to be released.
<p>Scott Crawford (electronicon@hotmail.com) has this to say about the
video:
<p>Once Upon Atari: The Agony And The Ecstasy is a great start to Howard
Scott
<br>Warshaw's Once Upon Atari video series. It's an entertaining, educational,
<br>and most importantly, REAL glimpse of what happened at good ol' Atari.
The
<br>video focuses on interviews with 2600 VCS programmers like Rob (Night
<br>Driver, Demon Attack, Missile Command) Fulop, Todd (Pac-Man) Frye,
Carla
<br>(Star Raiders, Warlords, Indy 500) Meninsky, and Larry (Air-Sea Battle,
<br>Kaboom!) Kaplan. These interviews are at times hilarious (Frye's description
<br>of how he programmed 2600 Xevious, Fulop's profanity-laden rant in
praise of
<br>VCS programmer Rick Maurer), as well as insightful (Ex-Atari Director
Of
<br>Software George Kiss' regret that he didn't write a line of code while
at
<br>Atari, Fulop's description of the job as "the definition of his life").
<br>While the video is a bit light on running time (at 28 minutes), it
is well
<br>worth picking up, as I've watched it about a dozen times in the 2 months
<br>since I got it.
<p>Stella at 20: An Atari 2600 Retrospective is a forthcoming documentary
from
<br>Glenn Saunders (krisha@cyberjunkie.com). Some bits of the documentary
are on
<br>the Stella at 20: An Online Preview
<br>(http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/1698/stellaat20.html) page. The
video
<br>will debut at the Classic Gaming Expo in Las Vegas this summer (Aug
14-15,
<br>1999).
<p>Q: Are there any other sources of general information about the 2600?
<p>A: Christopher James Pepin (cpepin1@hotmail.com) maintains the Atari
2600
<br>Fun Facts and Information Guide
<br>(http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/Stage/6058/stuff.txt), which
<br>contains bits of information culled from Usenet postings, mailing lists
and
<br>the 2600 connection.
<p>Q: What is irc, #rgvc and how do I get on them?
<p>A: irc is Internet Relay Chat, a global realtime chat network. #rgvc
is the
<br>rec.games.video.classic channel. At most times of the day or night
you can
<br>find someone on the channel eager to talk shop. Thursday nights at
8 EST
<br>used to be the weekly gathering time, although it isn't clear if it
still
<br>is. Note that the old rgvc irc channel #classic is no longer used for
this
<br>purpose; stick to #rgvc if you wish to discuss the 2600/7800.
<p>If you are on a unix box and your sys admin doesn't mind irc, you might
be
<br>able to get on with a simple
<p>irc -c '#rgvc'
<p>Alas, irc does not come preinstalled on most machines, so if the above
<br>command doesn't work or if you aren't using unix, you'll have to be
more
<br>resourceful. Here is an irc primer
<br>(http://www.byz.org/~bi/docs/ircprimer.html), complete with listings
of
<br>where to obtain irc clients.
<p>The Atari Gaming Headquarters site is the home of the #rgvc home page
<br>(http://www.atarihq.com/rgvc/index.html), which contains tips on irc
<br>etiquette, the #rgvc FAQ and a list of web pages and mail addresses
of the
<br>regulars.
<p>Q: What happened to the 5200 information that used to be here?
<p>A: Most of the 5200 information that used to reside in this FAQ was
either
<br>incomplete or horribly outdated. Keita Iida (keita@mindspring.com)
maintains
<br>the official 5200 FAQ (http://www.atarihq.com/5200/5200faq/index.html),
<br>which is both extensive and up to date. Most of the old entries now
live in
<br>an auxiliary document (http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~dzubera/5200exp.html)
<br>that is kept for historical purposes only and will not be updated.
<p>Q: What happened to Atari?
<p>A: The Atari that everyone knew, loved and hated is gone. On July 30,
1996,
<br>Atari merged with disk drive maker JTS with more of whimper than a
bang. Don
<br>Thomas (75300.1267@compuserve.com) has written a short, insightful
bit
<br>(http://www.Atari2600.com/museum/Goodby_nf.html) about the merger and
the
<br>history leading up to it that asks more questions than it answers.
<p>The story doesn't end there, however. On Feb 23, 1998, JTS sold
<br>substantially all of the assets of the Company's Atari Division, consisting
<br>primarily of Atari home computer games and the intellectual property
rights
<br>and license agreements associated with such games (the "Atari Assets"),
to
<br>HIACXI, Corp. ("HIAC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive,
<br>Inc., for $5,000,000 in cash. Read the entire 8-K form
<br>(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/941167/0001047469-98-009085.txt)
<br>that was submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding
this
<br>transaction.
<p>In a related note, JTS filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection on
<br>December 4, 1998, and then converted it to Chapter 7 on January 28,
1999.
<br>What is the difference between the two? Christina Wood from PC World
<br>magazine (July 1998, p. 41) says this:
<p>If the company has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, don't worry. The
<br>business should operate as usual -- it's just reorganizing. If the
company
<br>files under Chapter 7, worry. The enterprise is going out of business
and
<br>planning to liquidate its assets to pay off certain creditors.
<p>Q: But I still see games with the Atari logo. What's the story?
<p>A: In 1984, Warner Communications sold off the home (console) and consumer
<br>electronics (computer) divisions to the Tramiel family. These divisions
<br>became Atari Corp., which later merged with JTS and whose assets are
now
<br>part of Hasbro Interactive. The update of Centipede
<br>(http://www.atari-centipede.com) came (in small part) from the ashes
of
<br>Atari Corp.
<p>You may have also seen the Atari logo for years in the arcades under
the
<br>Time-Warner Interactive label (Atari Games). In 1996, TW sold Atari
Games to
<br>WMS Industries (the Williams people), who turned around and spun off
its
<br>Midway division (announced in 1997, completed (?) in 1998). Atari Games
<br>(http://www.atarigames.com) is now a subsidiary of Midway Games and
was
<br>responsible for games such as Gauntlet Legends and Rush the Rock. You
might
<br>also see the Atari logo for home conversions of these (and other) games
<br>under the Midway Home Entertainment label.
<p>Q: What scores were needed to earn an Activision patch?
<p>A: Rodney Siddall (rodneys433@aol.com) used to maintain the Activision
Patch
<br>FAQ
<br>(http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~bilstein/atari2600nexus/library/patchfaq.html).
<br>The above page contains the FAQ itself, as well as pictures of some
of the
<br>patches.
<p>Q: What does the Atari symbol represent?
<p>A: According to the Aug/Sep 1983 Video Games Player:
<p>The Atari symbol was designed by George Opperman in 1972. Pong was very
big
<br>then, and the big letter A represented two opposing video game players
with
<br>the center of the Pong court in the middle.
<p>Q: What does the word "atari" mean?
<p>A: The word atari comes from the game of Go, perhaps the world oldest
board
<br>game. Several early 80's magazine references define atari as "you are
about
<br>to be engulfed," but the rec.games.go FAQ denotes that word in this
way:
<p>atari : A group of stones is in atari if it has only one liberty left.
<p>Q: Where can I find games for my 2600/7800 or the consoles themselves?
<p>A: Auction web sites seem to have taken over as the primary method of
buying
<br>(and selling) on the net. Here are a few:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Ebay (http://www.ebay.com)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Yahoo Auctions (http://auctions.yahoo.com)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Auction Addict (http://www.auctionaddict.com)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * UAuction (http://www.uauction.com)
<p>Ebay seems to be the only one that has reached critical mass, as yet.
<p>There are still several sources for new game cartridges. Mail order
firms
<br>such as Telegames USA (http://www.telegames.com) are probably the best
<br>source for new games. They still stock many different games cartridges
for
<br>all the Atari game machines. Some titles they carry are uncommon or
rare.
<p>Best Electronics (http://www.best-electronics-ca.com) (2021 The Alameda,
<br>Suite 290, San Jose CA 95126-1127; (408) 243-6950) recently published
<br>Revision 10 of their Worldwide Catalog which contains 228 pages of
currently
<br>available Atari items. While it is an excellent resource for the Atari
<br>computer line and does present interesting pictures of console prototypes,
<br>pinout information and "collector items" like T-shirts, mugs and
<br>paperweights, it is a bit sparse in the 2600/7800 area. Much of the
&lt; 30
<br>pages dedicated to this area concerns itself with console, joystick
and
<br>miscellaneous parts (such as pots, switches and replacement motherboards),
<br>but not cart lists. It will also set you back $10.50 including shipping.
You
<br>can get each cart list (2600, 7800) by sending a "self-stamped full-sized
<br>business envelope with 1st class US postage" and a polite request.
[Mod
<br>note: probably one envelope per request or one envelope with lots of
extra
<br>postage.] Their web page is finally up, so you can see their cart lists
by
<br>following the above link as well.
<p>B &amp; C Computervisions (http://www.myatari.com) also carries both
new and
<br>used Atari games and consoles.
<p>Video 61 (http://www.angelfire.com/mn/video61) sells both new and used
2600
<br>and 7800 games and decks.
<p>Once in a great while, some retail stores will still have Atari cartridges
<br>in stock, although sometimes they are hidden in the back room. Another
good
<br>source is discount liquidator stores, such as Toy Liquidators, Big
Lots/Odd
<br>Lots, and Sears Outlets. These stores typically have huge quantities
of a
<br>limited number of titles at closeout prices.
<p>Radio Shack sells 2600/7800 and other classic games through their catalog.
<br>See the next question for a list of the games that they carry.
<p>O'Shea Ltd. (http://www.oshealtd.com/) has 1.3 million bulk atari games
for
<br>$.80 each plus S&amp;H. In the past, games had to be ordered in bulk
(quantities
<br>of 72, later 6), but Dauer (dauer@mcn.net) reports that one can now
order
<br>single carts. Contact Bill Houlehan (billh@oshealtd.com) for more
<br>information. Here's what they have:
<p>2600:
<p>Space Invaders / Baseball / Pac-Man / Football / Phoenix / Ms Pac-Man
/
<br>Dig Dug / Battlezone / Galaxian / Gravitar / Jungle Hunt / Kangaroo
/ Joust /
<br>Pole Position / Jr Pac-Man/ Solaris / Venture / Dark Chambers /
<br>Super Football / Crossbow
<p>7800:

<br>Hat Trick / Winter Games / Baseball / Dark Chambers / Donkey Kong /
<br>Donkey Kong Jr / Tower Toppler / Jinks / Barnyard Blaster / Mania Challenge
/
<br>Ninja Golf / Meltdown
<p>Sean McGrail (McGrail007@aol.com) points out that O'Shea has Super Huey,
<br>Midnight Mutants, Ace of Aces, Touchdown Football and Robotron, even
though
<br>they are not listed on the web page.
<p>O'Shea Ltd now has an online (albeit insecure) order form
<br>(http://www.oshealtd.com/atariorderform.htm).
<p>If you care more about playing than collecting, Hozer Video Games
<br>(randyc@east.sun.com) will put almost any 2K or 4K image on a cart
for $11
<br>($16 for royalty-included games); 8K images are $22 ($25 for
<br>royalty-included games). 16K carts may be available in the future.
This may
<br>be the only way to play games such as Wizard, Chase the Chuckwagon
or
<br>Cubicolor on your 2600. See the Hozer Video Games
<br>(http://www.angelfire.com/ma/hozervideo) site for more information.

<p>Q: Where can I download game instructions?
<p>A: Greg Chance (gchance@videogames.org) maintains a doc archive
<br>(http://videogames.org/cgi/2600-search.cgi) among other things on his
web
<br>page. Alexander Bilstein (bilstein@mail.utexas.edu) also maintains
an
<br>instruction manual archive
<br>(http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~bilstein/atari2600nexus/library/manuals/manuals.html).
<br>Between these two sites, you should be able to find manuals for most
of the
<br>2600 library.
<p>Q: What are the best games for the 2600?
<p>A: This can be a subjective matter, of course, but Mike Littau conducted
an
<br>informal 2600 games poll on rec.games.video (before the split) a few
years
<br>ago, trying to find answers to this very question. Here are the results,
<br>with some slight changes in format:

<p>In addition, The 2600 Connection (issue #10) ran an article on the 2600
<br>cartridge "Hall of Fame," listing the best 2600 games. There was an
<br>excellent capsule description of each game. Here is the list:

Q*Bert
<p>Q: What are the most common and most rare games for the 2600/7800?
<p>A: Commonality and rarity of a game depends upon many things, including
<br>geographical location, cart and label condition, label variation and
<br>personal experience. VGR's cart list, the Digital Press Collectors
Guide and
<br>JerryG's Beta One all give ideas to a cart's rarity and subsequent
worth.
<br>(VGR and the Digital Press Collectors Guide #4 use a scale, JerryG
and the
<br>DP cdrom use prices, and DPCG #5 uses both). For you unix folks, a
quick way
<br>to determine carts of a certain rarity is to download the plaintext
version
<br>of VGR's list, and then grep out the rarity that you want:
<p>grep " xx " filename > xx.list
<p>where 'filename' is the name of VGR's list and 'xx' one of VGR's rarity
<br>codes (C, U, R, ER, EP, UR, UP, NR; case is important). xx.list will
then
<br>contain the list of carts you are interested in.
<p>For those of you who yearn to know the prices carts have fetched in
the
<br>past, check out the Atari 2600/7800 Auction Price Database
<br>(http://www.valendor.com/acn-uk/auction.txt), which contains final
auction
<br>price information for hundreds of carts culled from many net auctions.
<p>Q: What was Gameline and what games were available for it?
<p>A: Gameline was a service offered by Control Video Corporation that
admitted
<br>the downloading of games to the the 2600 over regular phone lines (the
<br>Gameline was a 1200bps (300 bps?, variable 800-1500 bps?) modem). The
<br>Gameline Master Module originally sold for $49.95 and there was a one-time
<br>membership fee of $15. Charges were about $.10 a game or $1 for up
to an
<br>hour of play. Contest games were $1 and there was a $.50 charge to
enter a
<br>score. On your birthday, not only were you given free play for a day,
but
<br>you also received a Happy Birthday screen, complete with cake, candles
and
<br>music.
<p>Perhaps the funniest bit of advertising from CVC was in the form of
a Q&amp;A
<br>session. The Q was, "What will happen if I don't join Gameline?" The
A was
<br>"Eventually, you'll be the only one on your block without Gameline.
Your
<br>friends will have mastered new games before you even hear about them.
Are
<br>you willing to take that chance?"
<p>While the service did not last very long, the charred ashes of the service
<br>begat what is now AOL.
<p>The games that were available were:
<p>Airlock&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Q: Which 2600 games have voice?
<p>A: There are two: Quadrun and Open Sesame. Due to the limitations of
the
<br>2600, the screen is blank when the voice is played.
<p>Q: What 2600 carts do not work on the 7800?
<p>A: There are known incompatibilities with some NTSC versions of the
7800
<br>(PAL 7800s seem to be unaffected). Games that may not work include
Robot
<br>Tank, Decathlon, Space Shuttle, Time Pilot, Kool-Aid Man and the
<br>Supercharger. In a recent Usenet posting, Jay Tilton (tiltonj@erols.com)
<br>describes a series of tests with various versions of the 7800. In short,
<br>7800s manufactured in 1984 seem to be fully compatible, whereas those
<br>manufactured later have inconsistent incompatibilities. Here is an
edited
<br>version of the posting:
<p>I recently acquired another 7800 console, and discovered that it works
with
<br>the notoriously cranky Activision carts and the Supercharger. I decided
to
<br>sit down with all my 7800 decks and an armload of carts and see how
much of
<br>the 7800 compatibility mystery I could sort out.
<p>Test decks:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Board part number/revision is taken from the underside of the board,
just
<br>above the cart slot. The full number always begins with "CO25233."
The
<br>boards' top side has a different part number, "CO25234," but no revision
<br>level is given. Board dates are also taken from the underside of the
board,
<br>near the Atari logo. I changed the notation a bit to make sorting by
date
<br>easier. They're really written like "2584" instead of "84-25," which
would
<br>indicate the twenty-fifth week of 1984.
<p>The carts tested were:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Decathlon (2 different carts)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Robot Tank (3)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Space Shuttle (5)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Supercharger (2)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * 7800 Food Fight
<p>Results:&nbsp; "Yes"&nbsp; = cart works fine.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No"&nbsp;&nbsp;
= cart doesn't do a thing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Roll" = cart
works, but picture rolls.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lock" = cart
plays for a while, then locks up the system.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Whether or not a given cart works on a given deck depends
on both cart
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and deck. There's no real consistency among
different carts of the same
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; title.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * It looks like the Supercharger is the proof test of
whether a given
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deck will be fully compatible with any 2600
cart.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * The conventional wisdom saying that a deck with the
expansion port will
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work with anything is false. Presence or absence
of the port is not a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reliable indicator of compatibility with all
2600 carts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Likewise, the deck's geographical origin is not a reliable
indicator.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one manufactured in China (#5) has fewer
compatibility problems
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the others, but it still has some.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * The oldest deck (#1) performed flawlessly in all tests.
This is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probably from the earliest production run,
and was either sold in one
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the limited test-markets or was warehoused
until Atari Corp realized
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the home video game market was still viable.
<p>IMHO, the manufacturing standards of deck #1 are better than the others.
All
<br>the major chips inside are all socketed instead of being soldered directly
<br>to the board. Some of the other decks also have had some minor factory
<br>patchwork performed. They occasionally have resistors bridging points
where
<br>they were clearly not originally intended to be, i.e. soldered directly
to a
<br>chip pin or placed on the underside of the board.
<p>Wondering if that 7800 deck sitting in the thrift store could be one
of the
<br>fully-compatible ones? There are some very minor externally visible
<br>differences between my deck #1 and the others. I can't conclusively
say
<br>these are 100% reliable indicators, but they are conspicuously different.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * The labels on the undersides of decks 2-5 have a box
drawn around the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serial number. Deck #1 has no box drawn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * The serial number itself on deck #1 is different from
the others. The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "72R4BR" prefix is very much smaller than
the rest of the number.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "AT85037836" is one continuous string of black
characters with no
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spaces, while on deck #2 (#3-5 are similar),
"A1 76 5904610" does have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the spaces, and the "76" is stamped in blue.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * The cart contacts of deck #1 have a definite copper
color, while the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contacts of the others have a silvery appearance.
<p>Eric Chapin (wilykat@tds.net) has also run a series of compatibility
tests
<br>on his Atari 7800 and the results are on his web page
<br>(http://members.xoom.com/Wilykat/videogame/7800.html).
<p>One other note: both Chris Cracknell (crackers@hwcn.org) and George
Torch
<br>(vairxpert@hotmail.com) report that Superchargers may be permanently
damaged
<br>when used on the 7800. Chris suggests trying Robot Tank first and then
<br>proceeding only if that cart works. George adds that his dead Supercharger
<br>was the original one (Arcadia, not Starpath) and that the serial number
of
<br>his 7800 is 72R4BRA3055274987. If anyone else has experiences of 7800s
<br>ruining a Supercharger, please let me know.
<p>Q: What is the Starpath CD and can I still get one?
<p>A: The Starpath Supercharger Game Collection on CD, or Stella Gets a
New
<br>Brain was a non-profit, long-awaited labor of love from the CyberPuNKs
(Russ
<br>Perry Jr., Glenn Saunders, Jim Nitchals and Dan Skelton). This CD not
only
<br>contains NTSC and PAL versions of most of the Supercharger games (PAL
<br>Survival Island is missing), but also development tools, a collection
of
<br>Supercharger and Vectrex material, and several surprises (including
SoundX
<br>from Hozer Video Games and the UR Polo from Carol Shaw). While it was
an
<br>amazing value for $18 ($15 + $3 shipping), it is now sold out: you'll
have
<br>to look for rgvc sales or auctions if you wish to obtain one now.
<p>But fret not. Russ Perry Jr. mentions the following in Issue 51 of the
2600
<br>Connection:
<p>... the CyberPuNKs are in the process of re-releasing "Stella Gets A
New
<br>Brain"!&nbsp; We have permission already, and this time to make as
many copies
<br>as people want.&nbsp; The disc will be a little different this time
-- Polo
<br>won't be included, but there will be all kinds of stuff related to
<br>another CyberPuNKs project, a 20th anniversary documentary instead.
<br>We're looking into a possible professional release, but if that falls
through,
<br>we will just do another hobbyist release.&nbsp; We're hoping to have
something
<br>out by April, but seeing how long our first disc took to be released,
<br>we make no promises....
<p>and then in Issue 54:
<p>I know we're behind schedule on the re-release, but this is getting
<br>a bit ridiculous.&nbsp; Hopefully version 2 will be available at CG
Expo for
<br>any of you in attendance.
<p>For general information about the supercharger, see the supercharger
FAQ /
<br>Cyberpunks FAQ (http://www.primenet.com/~nickb/cybpunks.txt) which
contains
<br>some interesting information about the Starpath company, the supercharger,
<br>and the Cyberpunks.
<p>Q: Have any new games been released lately?
<p>A: Over the past couple of years, several new games have been developed
for
<br>the Atari 2600. Ed Federmeyer wrote both SoundX, a sound generator,
and
<br>Edtris, a Tetris clone. They are both available for $16 from Hozer
Video
<br>Games (mail randyc@east.sun.com for information).
<p>Rescue Bira Bira by Chris Cracknell (crackers@hwcn.org) is also available
<br>from Hozer (here is the binary image
<br>(http://www.hwcn.org/~ad329/birabira.bin)). RBB is a modification of
Jungle
<br>Fever with the adult bits removed. Chris' latest effort is a Video
Time
<br>Machine (http://www.hwcn.org/~ad329/clock-v3.bin) meaning a 24-hour
clock.
<br>It is also available from Hozer.
<p>Greg Troutman (mor@crl.com) recently posted a beta version of This Planet
<br>Sucks (http://www.crl.com/~mor/tps/tps.bin) on his web page.
<p>Piero Cavina (p.cavina@mo.nettuno.it) is the creator of Oystron, a shooter
<br>that is quite possibly the first game ever to feature space oysters.
Get the
<br>full story and the game from the Oystron Home Page
<br>(http://www.primenet.com/~nickb/oystron.htm).
<p>Eric Bacher recently authored Alfred's Challenge
<br>(http://www.best-electronics-ca.com/feature.htm), a platformer that
also
<br>alleges to work properly under any TV standard (NTSC, PAL or SECAM).
It is
<br>available for $20 from Best Electronics.
<p>Nick Bensema (nickb@primenet.com) maintains a page of links to newly
<br>developed 2600 games (http://www.primenet.com/~nickb/atari3.htm). Many
of
<br>the games listed in this section are there, as well as several others
<br>including Cubis, The Dark Mage and Mondo Pong.
<p>Bob Colbert (rcolbert@novia.net) seems to be the most prolific 2600
<br>developer of late. Okie Dokie (a puzzle game), Cheetah (a Game Genie-type
<br>program for the Supercharger or emulator), and now Stell-A-Sketch
<br>(Etch-a-Sketch clone) are all available from Bob's home page
<br>(http://www.novia.net/~rcolbert).
<p>Yak (Jeff Minter), author of Llamatron, Tempest 2000, Defender 2000
and the
<br>Jaguar Virtual Light Machine had some fun turning Space Invaders into
Beast
<br>Invaders (http://www.magicnet.net/~yak/beastinv.htm). I've been able
to
<br>track down only the picture of the game, but not the game itself. Anyone
<br>have a pointer?
<p>On a related note, VGR (vgr@clark.net) is the author of Indenture
<br>(http://www.clark.net/pub/vgr/ind/indent17.zip), a dos version of 2600
<br>Adventure, complete with larger levels and enhancements. See the Indenture
<br>FAQ (http://www.clark.net/pub/vgr/ind/indfaq.html) for more information.
<p>Q: What is a multicart and where can I get one?
<p>A: A multicart is simply a multiple game cart. Sean Kelly (skelly@xnet.com)
<br>makes them for both the 2600 and 5200. Prices for the 2600 are $65
for a 64
<br>game cart, $100 for a 128 game cart and $150 for a 256 game cart. The
5200
<br>cart contains nearly all games ever made (including prototypes) for
$125.
<br>Email him or see Sean's Web Page (http://www.xnet.com/~skelly) for
more
<br>information.
<p>Randy Crihfield (randc@east.sun.com) at Hozer Video Games also builds
<br>multicarts. A 128-in-1 cart is $100, as is a 32-in-1 Activision cart.
<p>Other examples of multicarts exist, including Atari's 32-in-1 for the
2600
<br>(PAL) and their 32-in-1 for the 7800 (which is a relabeled 2600 32-in-1;
all
<br>games on the cart are 2600 games). For information and a picture of
the 7800
<br>32-in-1 cart, see Dennis Remmer's 'Random Classic Game Stuff Page
<br>(http://www.dstc.edu.au/BDU/staff/dennis/vgames.html).
<p>Q: Where can I find a list of cheats and Easter Eggs?
<p>A: Galen Tatsuo Komatsu (gkomatsu@hawaii.edu) maintains the B-TECH list;
<br>mail him directly with "Send B-TECH" as your subject line. Note: this
is not
<br>a mailserver so please give him time to respond.
<p>Q: What programming resources are available?
<p>A: For 2600 users there is the 2600 Programming
<br>(http://videogames.org/2600Stuff/2600Programming) guide. The Stella
Guide
<br>(http://www.primenet.com/~nickb/stella.txt) is another useful document.
<p>Schematic, bankswitching and other 2600 technical information is available
<br>at Kevin Horton's 2600 page (http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/2600.htm).
<p>Another tech page which includes annotated source code for both combat
and
<br>adventure is Dan Boris' VCS page (http://atarihq.com/danb/vcstech.htm).
<p>A fairly comprehensive page is Nick Bensema's 2600 Programming Page
<br>(http://www.primenet.com/~nickb/atariprg.htm), complete with gobs of
source
<br>examples and programming tools.
<p>Bob Colbert (rcolbert@novia.net) provides many development tools for
the
<br>Supercharger (http://www.novia.net/~rcolbert/super.htm#super) on his
home
<br>page. These tools are different than those found on the Supercharger
CD.
<p>For the 7800 there was Harry Dodgson's (hdodgson@oeonline.com) Monitor
Cart
<br>plus documentation. The 250+ pages included a stella guide, a 2600
<br>programming manual which was a bit more readable, the Maria specs,
and the
<br>7800 docs plus numerous corrections to the Atari documentation. The
package
<br>price was around $65. Alas, Harry has said that no offers will get
him to
<br>make another monitor cartridge (he stopped making them a while ago
when he
<br>didn't sell any in a 6 month period). About 3 dozen total were made.
<p>Dan Boris's 7800 Tech Page (http://atarihq.com/danb/78tech.htm) also
<br>contains a wealth of information on the 7800.
<p>Q: What is the 7800 encryption algorithm?
<p>A: The 7800 uses a encryption key to determine whether or not the 7800
<br>cartridge is valid and to allow the system to be put in 7800 mode as
opposed
<br>to 2600 mode. The encryption algorithm is said to be proprietary. Rumors
<br>exist, however, that Atari released the algorithm for use on the the
Atari
<br>ST series of computers. If anybody has this program we would all be
very
<br>happy to have a look at it. It is also rumored that the code was released
<br>with the Lynx Dev-Kit for the Amiga, yet it does not appear in version
1.3.
<br>Rumors...rumors...
<p>Not a rumor, however, is that as designed, the 7800 required a valid
960-bit
<br>digital signature generated by Atari before a native 7800 game (as
opposed
<br>to a 2600 game) would run on the 7800; no digital signature, no Maria
chip.
<br>Also, crypto export restrictions (960 bits are a lot even for
<br>military-quality crypto) are probably the reason that European 7800
consoles
<br>and games have no digital signature.
<p>The final word on the encryption/authentication/validation/signature
bits of
<br>the 7800 (save for the key itself) with respect to emulation comes
from a
<br>section on Dan Boris' 7800 tech page called The Encryption Issue
<br>(http://atarihq.com/danb/78tech.htm). You'll have to scroll about 3/4s
of
<br>the way down to read the entry. In short, emulation of the 7800 is
<br>independent of the validation key, but the creation of new games that
will
<br>run on unmodified 7800s isn't.
<p>Q: Is 7800 Impossible Mission really impossible?
<p>A: Yes.
<p>The cart was released with a bug where some of the pieces you need were
<br>hidden under computer terminals, but the terminals cannot be searched.
This
<br>bug was fixed, but Atari probably never released the updated version.
The
<br>PAL version is not impossible, as the programmer of the PAL version
fixed
<br>the bug.
<p>Q: Where can I get solutions to the Swordquest series?
<p>A: Walton C. Gibson (kalla@aspark.ece.uiuc.edu) maintains the SwordQuest
<br>Comic Book Archive (http://www.tripoint.org/sq/sq.html) which contains
both
<br>the comics and the solutions.
<p>Q: I've seen pictures of 2600 Doom. Where can I buy it?
<p>A: You can't. It's a hoax. Here are the ones we currently know about:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * 2600 Doom
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arcade/8691/2600DOOM.HTM).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Electronic Gaming Monthly covered this in
their January 1998 (#102)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letters section.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Pitfall III. Lee Kreuger's bit of hijinx is documented
on page 224 of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DP #5.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Garfield. The cart has never been found, but some clever
chap faked a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; label for it. The DP cdrom has a jpg of the
label.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Original artwork for the Starpath games Swords of Saros,
Survival
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Island and Sweat!. The artwork for these games
on the Stella CD was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; created by Dan Skelton. This item is not a
hoax, as the CyberPuNKS were
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going after completeness, not deception.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * perl for the 2600. Issue #12 (vol 3, no 4; winter 1998)
of the Perl
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Journal shows perl as one of the carts in
a 2600 cart stack. For all
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you future deceivers, this image modification
was done with "the gimp."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * The Mar/Apr 1999 2600 Connection takes April 1 very
seriously by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reporting on Quake 3, Timber, Tron, Wacko,
Lucky Charms, a Camel
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cigarettes game, (big breath here) Tomb Raider,
Street Fighter II and a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microvision Emulator.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Final Fantasy VII (http://www.thegia.com/news/n990401a.html).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Mortal Kombat Trilogy. On his old web site, Ed Boon
displayed the box
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; art for MKT for the Atari 7800 (and the Astrocade
and the Channel F).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These pictures were not carried over to his
new web site. Did anyone
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; save these pictures?
<p>Q: What are the different 2600/7800 models?
<p>A:
<p>2600 models
<p>Atari VCS CX2600 - Original model. Woodgrain and black plastic enclosure.
<br>Light and heavy weighted plastic. Six silver switches across the upper
front
<br>panel. Bundled accessories included two CX40 joysticks, one CX30 paddle
<br>controller, AC adapter, TV switch and a CX2601 Combat game cart. Sample
<br>wording on label on bottom of unit:
<p>Mfd. by Atari, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA.&nbsp; Serial # 048181.
<br>Mfd. by Atari-Wong Ltd. in Hong Kong.&nbsp; Serial # 568213514.
<br>Manufactured for Atari Inc. by TRU Electronic Components Company in
Taiwan.
<br>Model NO: CX-2600 Serial # 81281713"
<p>Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade I - Same as above except external cosmetic
<br>differences (the "difficulty" switches are labeled "skill level", the
switch
<br>panel is silver instead of black, and the woodgrain pattern is different.)
<br>Sample wording:
<p>Mfd. for Atari Inc. by Dimerco Electronics in Taiwan for sale to
<br>Sears, Roebuck, and Co.&nbsp; Serial # 82077230.
<p>Atari VCS 2600A - Revised model. Externally it is nearly identical to
the
<br>original, except there are four silver switches across the upper front
panel
<br>instead of six. The difficulty switches were moved to the rear of the
unit.
<br>Internally, the motherboard is a simplified one-piece design. Sample
<br>wording:
<p>Mfd. for Atari, Inc. by TRW Electronic Components Co. in Taiwan.
<br>Serial # 811510200.
<br>Mfd. for Atari, Inc. by Atari Taiwan Mfing. Corp. in Taiwan.
<br>Serial # 827030354.
<p>Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade I(A) - Same as above except for external
<br>cosmetic differences. Sample wording:
<p>Mfd. for Atari Inc. by Dimerco Electronics in Taiwan for sale to
<br>Sears, Roebuck, and Co.&nbsp; Serial # 82299647.
<p>Atari VCS 2600A (black) - Second revised model. Externally it is nearly
<br>identical to the 2600A, except the enclosure has a more modern looking
<br>"black out" treatment. The areas of woodgrain on the original models
are now
<br>simply black plastic. Internally, the motherboard is a slight revision
of
<br>the 2600A. Sample wording:
<p>Mfd. for Atari, Inc. by Atari Taiwan Mfing. Corp. in Taiwan.
<br>Serial # AT831150153.
<p>Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade II - Entirely new model of the 2600 designed
<br>exclusively for Sears. Black wedge-shaped enclosure, with push button
<br>switches and LEDs on top panel. Essentially an Atari 7800 shell. Four
<br>joystick connectors on lower front panel with rocker switch. Internally
very
<br>different from other 2600 models, but still uses the same basic chipset.
<br>Bundled accessories include two combination joystick/paddle controllers,
AC
<br>adapter, TV switch and a Space Invaders game cart. Sample wording:
<p>Sears, Inc. (Atari, Inc.) Serial # SV 392 005539.
<p>Atari 2800 -- same as Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade II but with Atari
label.
<br>Released only in Japan. Very rare.
<p>Atari 2600 "Jr." - Third revised model. It is slightly larger than a
VHS
<br>video tape case. Some versions have "Jr" stamped onto the bottom sticker.
<br>Large black buttons. Power and b/w switches slide, while Reset and
Game
<br>Select are push buttons. Jet black with large metallic silver strip
running
<br>lengthwise across the front with "Atari 2600" on it. Marketed as the
"Under
<br>50 bux, the fun is back!" machine. Bundled accessories include one
joystick,
<br>AC adapter, TV switch box, and RCA connecting cable. Box is designed
as a
<br>carrying case with handle and a white section which reads: "This Atari
2600
<br>belongs to:". No bundled cart. The unit came in either a maroon or
silver
<br>box. Sample wording:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari Logo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ATARI &amp; FUJI LOGO]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MADE IN TAIWAN
<p>Atari 2600 "Jr." - same as above except silver plate has a larger rainbow
<br>strip without an embossed border.
<p>A few miscellaneous notes:
<br>All 6 switch Ataris had a large shield casing. There were at least
two
<br>6-switch versions:
<p>(6-1) The original. The entire bottom half of the console was made of
<br>quarter inch thick plastic (~6mm)! Combined with the thick aluminum
RF
<br>casing, this is the heaviest 2600 ever made. Also, this 2600 has no
2/3
<br>channel select switch. There is a channel select hole in the case and
it's
<br>marked Channel A/B, but there's no switch inside on the PCB. These
consoles
<br>came with "01 combat". (1977 models only)
<p>(6-2) The lighter 2600. No armor plating. Bottom half of console is
made of
<br>thin plastic, like the 4 switch models. Channel switch now present.
Thick RF
<br>shield still present. Plain ol' "combat" included.
<p>The were also minor variations on 4 front switch, woodgrain panel models.
On
<br>some, the difficulty switches are marked "Expert/Novice" (or was it
<br>"Advanced/Beginner"?) and others are marked only as "A/B".
<p>Finally, a hodge-podge of facts that don't fit anywhere else:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rumors persist that the pictures on the packaging varied.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Both Pac-Man (see Atari Age V2 #4) and Centipede were
pack-in carts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * 2600s were made in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Sunnyvale.
<p>7800 models
<p>Atari CX7800 - Vastly modified and enhanced 2600 model. Two joystick
ports
<br>on lower front panel. New chipset (except sound chip; pokey chips could
be
<br>added to carts). Side expansion port for upgrades and computer add
ons.
<br>Bundled accessories included two CX24 ProLine joysticks AC Adapter,
<br>switchbox, RCA connecting cable, and Pole Position II cartridge. Plays
all
<br>2600 games except 3 or so (which ones?).
<p>Atari CX7800 - Second Revision. Expansion port connector removed from
mother
<br>board but is still etched. Shell has indentation of where expansion
port was
<br>to be.
<p>Atari CX7800 - Third Revision. As above but only a small "blemish" mark
on
<br>shell.
<p>Q: What types of clones exist?
<p>A: Probably the most famous is the Gemini, an inexpensive clone 2600
made by
<br>Coleco. It sports an all black, box-shaped enclosure with six small
slide
<br>switches (say that fast) on top of front panel. On the back panel,
there is
<br>an RF modulator port and a power adapter port. Two joystick ports and
<br>difficult switches live on the front panel. Bundled bits include two
<br>dual-joystick/paddle controllers, a 9volt/500ma DC adapter, an RF cable,
a
<br>TV switch and Donkey Kong and Mouse Trap carts. Sample wording:
<p>Coleco Gemini VGS - Coleco Ind., Inc., Serial # AG0145189.
<p>Q: What companies made 2600 adapters for their own systems?
<p>A: ColecoVision Expansion Module #1 - Black, 5" x 10", 1 3/4" high in
front,
<br>sloping to 2 3/4" in back.

<p>Chips inside are: "COLECO 73192 E4002" (TIA clone?), SY6507, SY6532.
<br>Curiously, there is an empty space for a 14 pin chip and assorted resistors
<br>and capacitors on the right side of the circuit board. The space for
a "Y1"
<br>indicates that this was probably intended to be a clock generator.
(Could
<br>this board also be intended for standalone use, such as in the VGS?)
There
<br>is also an adjustment hole on the bottom that turns a potentiometer
<br>[probably color control]. The reset button on the main ColecoVision
console
<br>acts as a hard reset for the expansion module. The connection to the
<br>ColecoVision unit isn't very physically stable, at least not on carpet,
<br>resulting in flaky performance. Sample wording:

by
<br>Protecto in mail order ads in during the 1983 time frame. Plugged into
VIC
<br>expansion connector and provided 2600 software emulation. Original
price,
<br>emulation quality, and reliability all unknown.
<p>The September 1983 issue of Electronic Games (page 41) shows an
<br>advertisement for Cardapter, a 2600 cart adapter for the Vic-20. The
<br>distributor was Cardco, Inc. in the US, LSI Distributors Ltd in W est
<br>Canada, Hobby Craft Canada in East Canada, and Audiogenic in Europe.
<br>Additional information on this bit would be interesting.
<p>JerryG (jerryg@hevanet.com) maintains a list of both 2600 clones and
<br>changers
<br>(http://www.atari2600.com/museum/2600/2600%20hardware/2600HWtypes.html).
<p>Q: Are there any emulators for the 2600/7800?
<p>A: Dennis Brown (brownd@ns2.apmtech.com) maintains the 2600 emulator
FAQ
<br>(http://ns2.apmtech.com/dbrown/museum/texts/2600emu.faq). It focuses
mostly
<br>on the Activision Action packs and is also a bit out of date. The current
<br>version is also completely unreadable unless saved as text from your
<br>browser. Question 5.2
<br>(http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet-faqs/html/emulators-faq/part3/faq.html)
<br>of the comp.emulators.misc FAQ discusses emulators for the 2600 as
well.
<p>Speaking of the Activision Action packs, a word about them is an order
since
<br>they aren't covered anywhere else in the FAQ. Activision released a
total of
<br>5 titles (which included the games + an emulator):
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Atari 2600 Action Pack (Win 3.1, 486/33, 8 meg ram)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Atari 2600 Action Pack (Mac, 68LC040-25 MHz or PPC 601-60,
8 meg ram)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Atari 2600 Action Pack II (Win 3.1, 486/33, 8 meg ram)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Atari 2600 Action Pack II (Win95, 486DX (?), 8 meg ram)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Atari 2600 Action Pack 3 (?)
<p>According to Activision's Web site, here are the games on the three
packs:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Action Pack I: Boxing, Chopper Command, Cosmic Commuter,
Crackpots,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fishing Derby, Freeway, Frostbite, Grand Prix,
HERO, Kaboom!, Pitfall,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River Raid, Seaquest, Sky Jinks, Spider Fighter.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Action Pack II: Atlantis, Barnstorming, Dolphin, Dragster,
Enduro, Ice
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hockey, Keystone Kapers, Laser Blast, Megamania,
Oink!, Plaque Attack,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River Raid II, Skiing, Stampede, Tennis.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Action Pack 3: Breakout, Night Driver, Combat, Private
Eye, Space War,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StarMaster, Canyon Bomber, Checkers, Pressure
Cooker, Title Match Pro
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrestling and Yar's Revenge.
<p>While the packs may be hard to find in stores, the first two are available
<br>for pre-paid download from Activision's Download Store
<br>(http://activision.downloadstore.com/#atari2600a) for $12.95 each.
All three
<br>are available for pre-paid download from Joey Jim's
<br>(http://www.netsales.net/pk.wcgi/joeyjims/comp/115371) for $9.90 as
well.
<p>Activision also recently released its Classics Collection (30 games
+ an
<br>emulator) for the Playstation. Reviews of it can be found in Issue
51 of the
<br>2600 Connection, and the December 1998 Electronic Gaming Monthly.
<p>The January 1996 Ultimate Gamer mentions that Atari had some plans for
a
<br>2600 emulator for the Jaguar CD. Dave Staugas, who programmed both
Millipede
<br>and Krull, was working on it. According to Slapdash #6, it was approximately
<br>90% complete. With the demise of Atari, the probability of the emulator
<br>seeing the light of day is almost 0.
<p>Matt Pritchard (matthewp@netcom.com) mentions in a recent Usenet posting
<br>that the forthcoming commercial Intellivision emulator may include
a 2600
<br>emulator and images of all m-network/intv games (including unreleased
ones).
<p>For the 7800, we now have V7800 (http://atarihq.com/danb/files/v7800r12.zip)
<br>v. 0.12, courtesy of Dan Boris. He has also written a driver for the
next
<br>release of MESS (http://mess.emuverse.com), the Multi Emulator Super
System.
<p>Q: What 2600/7800 hardware was announced, but never released?
<p>A: The short answer is quite a bit . Here are some examples:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * 2600 keyboard by Atari, called the Graduate or My First
Computer. It
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was designed by Peripheral Visions Inc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * 2600 voice command system
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * a headband controller, Mindlink
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Atari 2700 - Remote control joystick/paddles, touch
sensitive console
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buttons.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Atari 3600 - 10-bit system, made it to prototype stage.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Amiga Power Module for 2600. Similar to the Supercharger,
it had dialup
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; capability (to play against others). Also,
some 3D games were planned
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it as well.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * U.S. Games Joystick, similar to Coleco Super Action
Controller (EF May
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 83, p. 91)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * 7800 High Score Cart
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * 7800 Keyboard, peripherals and computer games. The 7800
keyboard was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; designed by GCC Inc., the same company that
designed Ms. Pac-Man and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jr. Pac-Man for the 2600.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * 7800 adapter for the 5200 (!) (both a recent Usenet
posting and Phoenix
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mention this oddity)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * much, much more. Pictures of prototypes and the stories
behind them for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all three systems can be found at the Atari
History
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (http://www.atari-history.com/videogames/videogames.html)
site.
<p>Q: I've hooked up my system, but the picture is fuzzy. What am I doing
<br>wrong?
<p>A: The most probable cause is that you are using an automatic RF switch
<br>(i.e. one that does not physically have to be switched between the
"TV" and
<br>"game" position). Most (all?) systems starting with the NES use automatic
RF
<br>switches. These will not work for the 2600/7800, as the signal is not
strong
<br>enough to trigger the switch completely. A manual RF switch, available
at
<br>any Radio Shack or equivalent, is the way to happiness.
<p>Q: How do I fix my paddles?
<p>A: Dirty paddles are a cause of great frustration. To clean them, buy
a can
<br>of Cleaner/Degreaser (available at Radio Shack, catalog #64-4422),
open up
<br>the paddles and spray directly into the pot area. Close them up, give
them a
<br>few twists and they should be good as new. Silicon spray, WD40 and
TV tuner
<br>can also be used, although there are warnings about possible gumming
with
<br>WD40, and possible plastic rot with TV tuner.
<p>Q: Where do I get my 2600/7800 fixed?
<p>A: In general, it is usually more cost effective to simply buy another
<br>console. However, if you are in the UK, you may have another option.
Mark
<br>Hourahane (HOURAHANEM@harveygs.kent.sch.uk) claims to fix consoles.
He
<br>writes:
<p>"I would be happy to repair old Atari consoles of any format, although
I may
<br>not be able to test non-PAL machines. Anyone wanting repairs, modifications
<br>etc. should e-mail me."
<p>Q: Do Bally Astrocade joysticks work on the 2600/7800?
<p>A: No. Even though they use the standard 9-pin connector, the pinouts
are
<br>different. However, the Bally/Astrocade FAQ
<br>(http://www.interlog.com/~komb/Ballyfaq.html) documents the proper
rewiring
<br>scheme to allow them to work on the 2600/7800.
<p>Q: Which light guns work with the 2600/7800?
<p>A: There is no light gun made specifically for either system. However,
<br>Atari's light gun (model number XG-1) that came with the XE-Game-System
<br>works well. Additionally, Best Electronics sells the Best Lightgun
which
<br>supposedly works better than Atari's own. (comments?) Also, see the
entry
<br>for rewiring a Sega lightgun elsewhere in the FAQ.
<p>Q: What hardware peripherals exist for the 2600/7800?
<p>A: Note: This list is by no means complete.
<p>2600 peripherals
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Compumate - 42 key touchpad computer add on from Spectravideo.
Adds 16K
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ROM, 2K RAM, and has BASIC. Looks like a small
keyboard attached to a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cartridge, which is in turn connected to the
joystick ports. Originally
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sold for $79.99
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Copy Cart - from Vidco, allowed transfer of a game onto
a blank
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cartridge. Battery powered, not all games
can be copied because of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; memory limitations.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * CVC GameLine - Play games via modem. See Gameline entry
above.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Game Selex - from Starplex, allows 9 cartridges to be
plugged in at
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; once; turn a dial to choose the game.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Kid Vid Control - Coleco cassette recorder and cartridge
interface.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional wire connects recorder to joystick
port. Voices and songs
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tell player what to do on screen. Tape shuts
off automatically to wait
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for player input. 3 tapes per game, only games
were Berenstain Bears
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Smurfs Save the Day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Personal Game Programmer - By Answer, similar to Game
Genie.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * ROM Scanner - from Marjac, allows 10 cartridges to be
plugged in, press
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a button to choose game.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Starpath Supercharger - Large cartridge that plugged
into the 2600
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slot. It has a cable with standard 1/8" jack
for plugging into tape
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recorders. Games were distributed on cassette
tape. The unit itself
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contains 6K RAM and 2K ROM. ROM is in top
2K and RAM is banked in lower
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2K.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Video Game Brain - from RGA International Limited. A
multiple cartridge
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adapter that holds six games to play, and
contains 2 dummy slots for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional cart storage. You select the game
you want to play by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pushing a button in front of that cartridge.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Videoplexer by Compro was an 8 cart bankswitcher. It
had a smoke brown
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plexiglass hood and 8 sensor touch buttons
on the front panel. The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manual claimed to Reduce the wear on your
expensive system and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cartridges.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Unimex SP280 by Unimex. A game duplicator which copied
games to a EPROM
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cart. Available EPROM carts were 2K and 4K;
8K (and perhaps 16K) EPROMs
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were announced, but none have been seen. The
manual stated that the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carts could be erased by opening them and
placing the EPROM under a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tanning lamp (Unimex also offered erasing
services for a nominal fee).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * A fantastic number of different controllers. One list,
complete with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pictures

<p>Q: What are NTSC/PAL/SECAM and why should I care?
<p>A: NTSC (National Television Standards Committee), PAL (Phase Alternating
<br>Lines) and SECAM (SEquentiel Couleur Avec Memoire) are different worldwide,
<br>generally incompatible television standards. Some short, not completely
<br>accurate information follows.

<p>For detailed and accurate (but muddled) information, see the Worldwide
TV
<br>standards page (http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/contrib/WorldTV). Why is
this
<br>information important? Different carts will exhibit different
<br>characteristics based on what kind of TV and console are used. For
example,
<br>a PAL cart on an NTSC console and TV will roll the screen and exhibit
a
<br>strange color scheme. An adjustable vertical hold is a must in these
<br>situations. The console compatibility FAQ
<br>(http://www.gyruss.demon.co.uk/ccnuk/compat.html) details much of this
<br>information for the Atari 2600/7800 and other consoles as well.
<p>Q: What is a TV Boy and where can I get one?
<p>A: The TV Boy is a handheld-sized Atari 2600 (made by SystemA) with
127
<br>built-in games that connects to your tv (it does not have its own screen).
<br>While it features a built-in Gameboy-like joypad and external 9-pin
ports so
<br>one can connect one's favorite controller, it does not, alas, have
a
<br>cartridge slot. Inside the TV Boy is a jumper marked "NTSC/PAL," so
it
<br>appears that it will work on either type of TV.
<p>There is also a TV Boy II which does not have external 9-pin ports.
Thus,
<br>there is no way to play two-player (simultaneous) games (only the built-in
<br>directional pad is left) with two players; In two-player games the
pad
<br>controls both players at the same time. For example, in Traffic (nee
<br>Freeway), the pad controls both chickens.
<p>For PAL preferers there is the MegaBoy which is nearly identical to
the TV
<br>Boy, although it has only 126 predominately PAL games.
<p>If things weren't confusing enough, Ian Pleasance (tspigp@rbkc.gov.uk)
adds
<br>the following:
<p>"...there are also PAL versions of the TV Boy I and TV Boy II. The TVB1
<br>is exactly the same physically as the US version, whereas the TVB2
had
<br>a design change and is shorter, it also adds a 127th game (pirated
<br>MegaMania), and had the second joystick port removed (on games with
a
<br>two-player option the second joystick is rerouted to the Joypad). Both
<br>the TVB1 and TVB2 were sold in the UK by SystemA.
<p>"SystemA also recently launched the "Super TV Boy", renamed the TVB2
<br>to "TV Boy" and dropped the TVB1.
<p>The Super TV Boy is the same internally as the TVB2, however the
<br>casing has changed drastically, and the internal joypad is now
<br>"removable" in that it clips on to the main unit case and is attached
<br>by a wire, so you can unclip it and play it at a distance. The Super
<br>TV Boy looks in some ways like a mini-NES except that half of the casing
<br>is bright pink (!).
<p>More information on the TV Boy can be found courtesy of JerryG, who
<br>maintains the TV Boy page
<br>(http://www.atari2600.com/catalog/Specials/GamTVBoy.html).
<p>The MegaBoy is not available from anywhere we know of. NTSC TV Boys
<br>($199.95), PAL TV Boy II's ($89.95) and PAL Super TV Boys ($99.95)
are
<br>available from JerryG. Argos, a UK mailorder company, has TV Boys for
24.95
<br>pounds, but they do not take orders from outside Great Britain or Northern
<br>Ireland. (Argos Customer Service: 01908 600 161; Direct Home Delivery:
0345
<br>427 467; the TV Boy catalog number is 364/4834). Gultronics in Tottenham
<br>Court Road, London, England as well as Index, a UK-wide catalogue shop
both
<br>sell the TV Boy and Super TV Boy. Finally, one can also purchase TV
Boys
<br>direct from SystemA (SystemA (UK) LTD, 12 Albury Close, Loverock Road,
<br>Reading, Berkshire, RG30 1BB) for approximately $50.00 + shipping and
<br>handling.
<p>JerryG, in an email message, mentions a completely different MegaBoy
(from
<br>South America) that does not include built-in games, but rather has
a
<br>cartridge slot (!).
<p>Finally, The Maverick (themaverick@volcano.net) mentions that a 7800
<br>controller plugged into the left joystick port (but not the right port)
of
<br>the TV Boy will keep it from operating. Corroboration anyone?
<p>Q: What are the specs for the 2600/7800?
<p>A: The information here is incomplete in some places, misleading in
others,
<br>and possibly just plain wrong in still other places.

<p>Q: How large do 2600 games get?
<p>A: There are several 2600 games with 16K bytes (e.g. Road Runner). There
are
<br>also games with 128 bytes of RAM on the cartridge (called the Atari
Super
<br>Chip), such as Jr. Pac-Man. Supercharger games that do multiple loads
may be
<br>even larger (which ones?; the Supercharger people should know.) Fatal
Run is
<br>32K. The 32-in-1 cart is 64K, 2K per game. The MegaBoy cart from Dynacom
is
<br>also 64K, 16 banks of 4K.
<p>Kevin Horton (khorton@iquest.net) maintains a detailed list
<br>(http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/files/sizes.txt) of cart sizes and
<br>bankswitching methods, from which most of the above information is
culled.
<p>Q: Are there any published 2600/7800 technical articles available?
<p>A: Andy Clayton was kind enough to type up Design Case History: the
Atari
<br>Video Computer System
<br>(http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~bilstein/atari2600nexus/library/design_case.html)
<br>from the March 1983 IEEE Spectrum. It is quite an interesting read
although
<br>it contains no code.
<p>IBM's patent server (http://patent.womplex.ibm.com) also contains a
wealth
<br>of information including many Atari patents.

<p>2600 cartridge pinouts
<p>A standard 2600 cartridge contains the equivalent of a 2716 or 2732/2532
<br>with one notable exception: the chip select line is active high, not
low.
<br>The high order address line of the 6507 (A12) is used as the chip enable.
<br>There was at least one company that used EPROMs with a 74LS04 inverter
to
<br>compensate for this. Note that numbers indicate left to right numbering.

<p>Notes:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * On both cartridges that were opened, GND was also connected
to SGND.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best to make sure that they are wired together.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * A11 and A12 could be switched. On both the chips I've
checked, A12 was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hardwired to +5 volts which leads me to believe
that it is the highest
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; address line. Since I believe that these chips
are only 4Kx8 ROMs, this
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seems logical, since A12 would actually be
just the chip enable for ROM
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (right?). Only the 2600 info tells differently,
and it doesn't give any
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connection for A11 on the EPROM, so I don't
trust it. Unfortunately,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since the 2716 EPROM is used as an example,
we won't know without
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actually trying one, since the 2716 doesn't
really use A11 or A12 and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; either one could be used as a chip enable.

<p>[looking into the power supply]
<p>If you are handy with a soldering iron, you can get a more standard
jack and
<br>just solder it in parallel with the original connector, then buy a
power
<br>supply at Radio Shack for a few bucks.
<p>One good place to solder alternate power connections is to the two joints
on
<br>the underside of the board, located near the original power plug (the
<br>polarity is easy to follow because the traces from the power and to
the
<br>barrel capacitor are polarity-marked). Either an external jack (1/8"
mono)
<br>can be run through the old jack's hole (or a vent hole) -or- an internal
<br>jack can be installed where convenient such as the thick "strut" near
the
<br>original hole or on the right side (when facing the unit for play).
You can
<br>use a 2600 power supply; the only difference is half an amp, which
the
<br>techies say doesn't matter much.
<p>Q: How do I build a composite/audio/chroma/luma output interface for
the
<br>Atari 2600Jr/2600A?

<p>File revision 1.1
<p>After finding my entertainment budget disappear (poor university
<br>student) I was forced to economize--I dusted off the Ole'2600.
<br>I figured I would hook it up to my computer monitor, but to my
<br>dismay there was no composite output on the beast (Atari).
<br>Determined to overcome, I quickly disassembled it. After some
<br>poking and prodding around I managed to locate the required
<br>signals.
<p>Benefits:&nbsp; No longer require a TV. You no longer require those
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; god-awful
switch boxes. No more interference patterns
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the
screen (from the RF cable being used as a bloody
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; antenna).
No longer requires the 100' hookup RF cable.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crisp
clear audio etc;
<p>Drawbacks: No longer get to see sister trip in 100' RF cable. No
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longer
get to fall asleep with psychedelic interference
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patterns
on screen.
<p>Materials Required:
<br>&nbsp; Phillips screwdriver, a soldering iron, solder, a small piece
of
<br>&nbsp; wire, 2 or 3 patch cables and a small pair of needle-nose pliers.
<p>* The following schematic is for the NEWER model which is sometimes
<br>&nbsp; referred to as the "Atari Junior".&nbsp; The older model is
much the
<br>&nbsp; same.
<p>1-Simply unplug everything from your console, turn it over and
<br>&nbsp; remove the 5 screws.
<br>2-Remove the top and bottom plastic case pieces. When removing the
<br>&nbsp; TOP piece carefully pull out the ribbon cable that connects
it to
<br>&nbsp; the main board.
<br>3-You should now have the board (covered by a metal shield) in your
<br>&nbsp; hands. Turn it over, you will see little clasps on the edge
of the
<br>&nbsp; shield that hold it in place. Straighten these with your pliers
<br>&nbsp; and you can then remove 2 LARGE shields (One on Bottom of unit,
<br>&nbsp; one on Top). The small shield remaining (On Top) covers the
RF
<br>&nbsp; modulator.
<br>4-Orient the exposed board into the position that it would normally
<br>&nbsp; be in. ie: The way it is when you play (On/Off switch near Top
<br>&nbsp; Left).
<br>5-Look in the LOWER RIGHTHAND AREA of the TOPSIDE (front) of the
<br>&nbsp; board. You will see a setup that resembles the schematic below.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>NOTE: You can connect the Audio to EITHER side of the Capacitor,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the best results are obtained by placing
it on the BOTTOM
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Capacitor (as shown).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chroma *MUST* be hooked up to the
BOTTOM of the resistor
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (as shown).&nbsp; It will NOT work if
you hook it to the top of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the resistor.
<p>To gain Chroma/Luma/Audio output you will need 3 RCA patch cables
<br>[the kind commonly used with stereos]. Simply solder the cables at
<br>the required points (Chroma/Luma/Audio) as shown. Remember to GROUND
<br>ALL cables! ie: solder the GROUND wire [the wire that wraps around
<br>the inner wire] to any point that the board shield connects to.
<p>To gain Composite/Audio output you need 2 RCA patch cables [the kind
<br>commonly used with stereos]. Here it gets a little different than
<br>above. Simply solder a "jumper" [a piece of wire] from R41 (Chroma)
<br>to TP5 (Luma), then connect a patch cord to TP5 [Presto! you now have
<br>composite]. Solder the remaining cable to C19 (Audio). Again, remember
<br>to GROUND all cables. Do *NOT* GROUND the jumper!
<p>Simply re-assemble the unit and you are done. You will find that it
<br>is easier to have the newly installed cables exit through the joystick
<br>port. Alternatively, you could cut a notch in the case for a separate
<br>exit. Having the cables exit through the RF output is not recommended.
<br>There will not be enough room (without pinching the cables) to hook
up
<br>the RF cable. Adjust your brightness/contrast. Enjoy!
<p>If you ever wish to adjust your color (chroma) there is a "POT" that
<br>you can tweak. It can be found near the OFF/ON switch. It is the only
<br>pot on the left side of the board.

..........
<p>The CD4050 is a video buffer. It provides a sharper signal than just
picking
<br>the signals off of the TIA, which is an unbuffered and open collector.
The
<br>unused buffer inputs are tied to ground to reduce noise (pins 14&amp;11).
On the
<br>outputs of the buffer, the 3 Luma pins and Sync are combined into what
will
<br>become Luma. Each Luma signal is supposed to be twice as bright as
the
<br>previous one, so the resistance on each Luma pin is roughly 1/2 the
previous
<br>one. If you cannot find the exact values, at least try to be within
10% or
<br>stack values to get close. The Sync signal is added in via a diode
to
<br>protect the output of the buffer and is dropped slightly through a
750 ohm
<br>resistor.
<p>Next, the combined Luma signal is connect to 5v &amp; ground through
resistors
<br>to reference the voltage for the base of Q1, our Luma amplifier. Its
output
<br>is set to 75 ohm impedance (75 ohms is best but 70-100 ohms will work
in the
<br>place of the 75 ohm resistors. The closest Radio Shack has is a 1/2
watt 82
<br>ohm resistor 271-011 which works fine).
<p>The Chroma signal is picked off the board at the junction of C210 and
R210.
<br>Looking at the board, R210 is the 4th component from the right in the
bottom
<br>row of resistors/capacitors under the shield. It connects to C210 (5th
<br>component from the right) at the top of both components, and this is
where
<br>to solder the wire for the Chroma circuit.
<p>The Chroma circuit is just a simpler version of the Luma amplifier.
Again,
<br>the output is 75 ohm impedance.
<p>The Audio circuit is simply a capacitor to filter out the DC offset
on the
<br>audio signal. Pick the audio signal off the board at the junction of
R206
<br>and C208. R206 is the 4th component from the right in the 2nd row of
<br>components at the bottom. Solder the Audio wire at the bottom of R206
and/or
<br>C208 (3rd component from the right).
<p>Be sure to solder the outer shield from the RCA cables to ground and
connect
<br>the signal to the inner conductor. Also, do not disconnect any pins
of TIA
<br>from the circuit (if the pins are lifted out of the socket or PCB,
the open
<br>collector outputs will no longer function).
<p>I used a small piece of perfboard from Radio Shack and hot-glued it
into the
<br>2600 case and made a small hole in the RF shield to run the wires to
the new
<br>board. I ran the RCA cables (Chroma, Luma, Audio) out the hole for
the RF
<br>cable.
<p>I'd like to acknowledge Ben Poehland and Charles Cole whose Super Video
<br>upgrades are the basis for this project. When you complete this circuit,
<br>your 2600's picture quality will be comparable to a Super Video upgraded
<br>Atari 8-bit.

+-----------------+---+--- Ground
<p>This is a simple common emitter amplifier. It is a non-inverting current
<br>amplifier and serves here to allow the video signal from the game to
drive a
<br>standard composite monitor with 75 ohm impedance.
<p>In order to prevent the audio from interfering with the video signal,
the
<br>mixing oscillator must be disabled on the main circuit board. On a
7800,
<br>remove the base lead of Q1. It is located near the RF modulator.
<p>The audio doesn't need any extra buffering.
<p>Places to get signals:
<p>1. from RF modulator
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; pin 3 is video
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; pin 1 is ground
<br>2. from Expansion Interface on 7800
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; pin 1 is ground
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; pin 2 is +5V
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; pin 3 is video
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; pin 17 is audio
<br>3. from main circuit board
<br>on a 7800, video and ground are across C7; +5V and audio are across
C4
<p>This circuit may not work or be required with all versions of the 2600.
It
<br>is required for the 7800 and the Sears Video Arcade II version of the
2600.
<br>It is probably not necessary for a 5200.
<p>Q: How do I convert Sega controllers to Atari pinout?
<p>A: [Note: Based on a non-random sample of size 2, it was found that
<br>unmodified Sega controllers work fine on the 2600/7800, with B acting
as the
<br>single fire button. Use the instructions below if you wish to have
a truly
<br>7800 compatible stick with 2 separate fire buttons.]
<p>[editor's note: who is this talking?]
<br>First the Disclaimer. I am not responsible for:
<br>1. Any damage done to your Atari 7800 or Atari 2600.
<br>2. Any damage done to the Sega Genesis Controller.
<br>3. Any errors in these instructions.
<p>This design is free for you to make your own controllers or adaptors.
If you
<br>make controllers or adaptors to sell to other people, I would like
(no
<br>surprise here) a cut of the profits. The only other thing I ask is
that if
<br>make your own, drop me an email so I get an idea of how many people
are
<br>using my design.
<p>I'm not going to give step by step instructions. I'm going to assume
that
<br>the reader has some basic knowledge of electronics and can figure out
what
<br>to do with the schematics and info presented here. I will, however,
answer
<br>questions if asked.
<p>This design works with the Atari 2600 as well as the Atari 7800. Also,
any
<br>system that can use Atari 2600 joysticks, should be able to use this
design.
<br>This design can be put inside a Sega Genesis controller or with the
addition
<br>of two 9 pin connectors, it can be made into an adaptor. It works with
any
<br>Sega Genesis controller including those with autofire.

<p>Q: How do I convert a Sega Master System lightgun to Atari pinout?
<p>A: The Aug 1988 (Vol 7, Num 4) Antic Magazine contained an article called
<br>First look: Inside the XE Game System: Hardware surprises revealed.
It
<br>described the conversion:
<p>To modify the Sega gun for the Atari, you'll have to cut off the
<br>incompatible connector. The wires must be stripped back and soldered
into an
<br>Atari joystick connector as follows:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SEGA GUN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ATARI JOYSTICK PORT
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blue wire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pin 1 stick FWD
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gray wire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pin 6 trigger
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Green wire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pin 7&nbsp; +5 volts
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black wire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pin 8 Ground
<p>Because of the close fitting connections for the XEGS ports, don't wire
in a
<br>DB9 female connector that has "ears". Most joysticks don't have wires
for
<br>unused signals, so cutting up an old joystick cable may not work.
<br>Specifically, an Atari joystick does not need the +5 volts, so there
isn't
<br>likely to be a wire connected to Pin 7. However, you can find joystick
<br>extension cables at Radio Shack, which have all nine pins wired from
male to
<br>female. Antic disclaims responsibility for any damages that might occur
<br>during improper implementation of this, or any, hardware modification
<br>project we publish.
<p>Once it's all hooked up, you'll notice that gun fires when you release
the
<br>trigger, which is annoying. The Sega trigger wiring is the opposite
of what
<br>the Atari light gun uses. To rewire the trigger switch, remove the
five
<br>screws (one is under the Sega logo on the side). Find the trigger
<br>micro-switch with three connections. Wire to the normally closed contacts.
<p>Q: How do I convert an NES controller to Atari pinout?
<p>A: See the following link
<br>(http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/Stage/6058/2600nes.txt) for
<br>step-by-step instructions. You will need a 2600 controller connector
cable
<br>to make this work.
<p>Q: Is there a general site that contains all this conversion stuff?
<p>A: Yes. Jay Tilton (tiltonj@erols.com) maintains a page
<br>(http://www.erols.com/tiltonj/games/tech/index.html) of various video,
<br>joystick and lightgun pinouts and conversions for the 2600, 7800 and
many,
<br>many others.
<p>Q: What is an Atari Game Recorder and how do I build one?
<p>A: An Atari Game Recorder is a device that copies carts to cassette
tape and
<br>also admits the playing of games from tape. Instructions and schematics
are
<br>in the following issues of Radio Electronics (it's a three-part article):
<p>Dec 84 vol 55 no 12 p. 69-72.
<br>Jan 85 vol 56 no 1 p. 51-58.
<br>Feb 85 vol 56 no 2 p. 69-72.
<p>The article was written by Guy Vachon and David A. Chan. The construction
of
<br>the AGR is not for the faint of heart, but if anyone does decide to
<br>construct an AGR, please mail Zube and provide details of how well
it works
<br>and any problems encountered in its construction. BTW, the AGR as described
<br>in the article does not handle bankswitched carts.
<p>I (Zube) have scans of the articles, but cannot keep them online. If
anyone
<br>is willing to host the files (12 jpgs of roughly 300K each), please
contact
<br>me.
