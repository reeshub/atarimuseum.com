<br>FOREWORD
<br>--------
<p>BY SEAN KELLY
<p>I don't know that I would call myself anything of an expert on the
<br>Atari 5200, but I have played virtually every game for the system and
<br>actually like many of them whereas I'm not a real big fan of the
<br>2600.
<p>The one thing that comes to most people's minds when the subject of
<br>the 5200 is brought up is its God-forsaken controllers, and
<br>rightfully so - they're undoubtedly one of the worst controllers made
<br>for any system in my opinion. However, the problem that I'd like to
<br>address for a few here is the fact that its lousy controllers have
<br>overshadowed the system overall which is NOT cool. Intellivision
<br>fans have dealt with what most people consider awful controllers, but
<br>they still enjoy many of the good games Mattel put out for the system
<br>so it doesn't make much sense why the 5200's faults can't be
<br>overlooked in the controller department - or does it.
<p>Atari launched the 5200 on the heels of what was (and still is) one
<br>of the most popular videogame systems of all time - the 2600. A
<br>system that set a standard for controllers to be followed for
<br>decades. Mattel went in its own direction from day one and pretty
<br>much went after people looking for a little more out of their video-
<br>games. Not necessarily "more" overall, but in terms of involvement.
<br>While the 2600 has several different types of controllers available
<br>for it, the system's basic capabilities just didn't offer the
<br>programmer much of a chance to get too far into their games no matter
<br>what controller they programmed it for.
<p>So as game systems advanced and Atari began to realize that there was
<br>only so much that programmers were going to be able to get out of the
<br>2600, they came up with what was called the "Video System X" in its
<br>early stages of development. The system was to have a keypad like
<br>Intellivision and Colecovision, probably an excellent idea on Atari's
<br>part as it allows for a much wider array of gameplay options, but
<br>then they apparently felt they had to revolutionize the controller
<br>industry once again and decided to attach an analog joystick to that
<br>keypad!
<p>The 2600's controllers are what's called "digital," meaning you are
<br>either pressing a button or you're not. The joystick itself is
<br>simply a set of four buttons under the stick that you unknowingly
<br>press when you move the joystick in a direction. An analog signal
<br>measures HOW FAR you're moving the joystick which, here again I have
<br>to admit, does make for some interesting gameplay options, but since
<br>the 5200's sticks do not spring back to the center position when you
<br>let go of the stick it's difficult to get used to.
<p>Who's gonna complain about the keypad they came out with though?
<br>Start, pause and reset right on the controller? Gotta like that a
<br>lot!
<p>Now the games made for the 5200 are a completely different story and
<br>pretty much the whole point of my writing here. Most of the games on
<br>the system are fantastic! If you look at the games released for the
<br>Atari 400/800, which uses standard digital joysticks, they were
<br>excellent in many cases. The computer didn't have the controller
<br>problems the 5200 had and the games and computer were very well
<br>received. Since the 5200 is nothing more than an Atari 8-bit 400/800
<br>with a few minor modifications, like games, for the most part, are
<br>quite similar, if not exactly carbon copies! Of course, the 5200 had
<br>many games that were not available on its 8-bit computer counterpart
<br>(and quite a few games that were available for both systems were
<br>superior on the 5200), so it's definitely worth getting into if you
<br>haven't already. Some of the classic ports are excellent and still
<br>not found on any other system. Space Dungeon immediately springs to
<br>mind.
<p>Some of the third-party controllers you will find described here
<br>overcome the problems of Atari's controller and could practically be
<br>called life-savers for the system. Check into a Competition Pro or
<br>Wico joystick if you absolutely cannot stand the Atari sticks.
<br>Better still is the Masterplay Interface if you can get your hands
<br>on one - they're pretty hard to come by.
<p>Judging the system by its controllers sucks in my opinion. Try and
<br>work around them if you can't deal with them and you'll be treated
to
<br>a library of some of the very best games ever made!
<p>==========================
<br>1.0) GENERAL INFORMATION
<br>==========================
<p>1.1 -- WHAT IS THE ATARI 5200 SUPERSYSTEM?
<br>------------------------------------------
<p>The Atari 5200 SuperSystem premiered in 1982, and was the successor
<br>to the venerable VCS (2600) which dominated the first wave of
<br>cartridge-based home videogame systems. The 5200 offered improved
<br>graphics and several features not found on any other system during
<br>its time.
<p>When the 5200 was first unveiled, Atari had solid reasons for
<br>optimism. After all, beneath the sleek, uncluttered exterior of the
<br>unit lurked the throbbing power of a 16K computer designed
<br>specifically to play high-quality games. The heart of the Super
<br>System was, in essence, an Atari 400/800 computer, the most powerful
<br>8-bit home computer system of its era, and thus games could
<br>theoretically be easily (and rapidly) ported between the two
<br>machines.
<p>The controllers have a small calculator-sized numeric keypad and two
<br>fire buttons are located at each side. The controller was a gallant
<br>attempt at cross-breeding the trak-ball and conventional joystick.
It
<br>uses an analog control mechanism, offering a full 360 degrees of
<br>mobility instead of the usual 4 or 8 positions. There is a speed
<br>control built-in, which, on specific cartridges, allows the player
to
<br>speed up the action. The harder the stick is pushed to any given
<br>direction, the faster the on-screen moving object will zip across the
<br>playfield. Also found on the controller is a "pause" button which
<br>enables the player to put any game on hold for as long as he likes.
<br>This now-standard feature on modern systems was first pioneered on
<br>the 5200. Atari's attempt at revolutionizing the joystick, however,
<br>turned out to be a mixed bag. The controllers do not self-center,
<br>making games like Pole Position and Star Raiders a joy to play. On
<br>the other hand, games that demand precise, 4-way input from the
<br>player (like Pac-Man) can be an exercise in frustration for many
<br>gamers. In addition, the joysticks are infamous for being among the
<br>most unreliable controllers ever made.
<p>In addition to the then-futuristic but flakey controllers, the
<br>SuperSystem offered several other advancements in hardware design.
<br>4-port 5200 systems utilized a special switch box where the power
<br>supply plugs directly into the switch box and not the system itself.
<br>Furthermore, the switch box was automatic, meaning the user was no
<br>longer required to walk to the back of the television and select
<br>between "TV" or "Game" each time to select the mode he or she
<br>desired (later 2-port systems reverted back to the standard RF
<br>switchbox found in just about ever other game console.) In
<br>addition, a special feature only found in the 5200 put the screen
<br>on silent black when you change cartridges (no more raspy white
<br>noise.)
<p>Although the 5200 enjoyed moderate success during its heyday, the
<br>gaming public never completely warmed to the SuperSystem, and the
<br>"Great Videogame Crash of 1983" helped to seal its fate along with
<br>the rest of the home videogame consoles. It should be noted,
<br>however, that the 5200 was outselling the Colecovision when Atari
<br>decided to pull the plug on its advanced video game system in 1984.
<p>The software selection at launch consisted mostly of proven but tired
<br>classics that failed to utilize the 5200's audio/visual talents.
<br>Titles such as Super Breakout, Galaxian and Space Invaders were
<br>unsuccessful in generating excitement among gamers who were looking
<br>for the "next wave" in console gaming. Once the system passed
<br>through its introductory period, however, Atari began to liberally
<br>salt the 5200 library with glittering new gems like Qix, Vanguard,
<br>Robotron:2084, Space Dungeon, Pengo, Joust and Ms. Pac-Man. Atari
<br>also had first call on games marketed by its coin-op arm, which
<br>brought arcade hits such as Dig Dug, Pole Position and Centipede
<br>home. By the time the 5200 was settled in with a respectable library
<br>of quality titles, however, it was too late. The Great Crash of 1983
<br>was well under way, and the 5200 joined the likes of Colecovision,
<br>Vectrex, Intellivision and others as the home console market came
<br>crumbling down. As a result, there is an inordinately high number of
<br>prototypes which exist for the 5200.
<p>Upon hindsight, the reasons as to why the 5200 never became the sales
<br>success that Atari had hoped are quite apparent. Despite being a
<br>large company for its time, not even a behemoth like Atari had the
<br>means to support four product lines with quality games for each
<br>(2600, 5200, 400/800 and coin-op). Resources which should have been
<br>allocated for 5200 game development went instead to the 2600, a
<br>system which was on its last legs and already saturated with software
<br>from Atari and its third party publishers. In addition, the fact
<br>that the 5200 was not compatible with the 2600 put off many 2600
<br>owners who had accumulated a substantial library of games for the
<br>system (a VCS adapter which allowed 2600 games to be played on the
<br>5200 was later released). Furthermore, although the 5200 was a
<br>quantum leap beyond the 2600 in terms of technology, the SuperSystem
<br>was not that much better than Colecovision and Vectrex. But perhaps
<br>the main factor that led to the doom of the 5200 -- and, for that
<br>matter, the entire home gaming industry -- was the result of the
<br>rapid price drop of affordable game-oriented computers like the Atari
<br>800XL and Commodore 64, both of which were sub-$300 gaming machines
<br>that also doubled as computing and productivity devices.
<p>Today, the Atari 5200 is a favorite among retrogamers, nostalgists
<br>and collectors. While many of the coin-op translations have
<br>subsequently been improved upon by modern systems, there are
<br>an abundance of compelling games that no gamer should be without.
<br>Space Dungeon, Rescue on Fractalus, Qix, Beamrider, Gremlins, Bounty
<br>Bob Strikes Back (the spectacular sequel to Miner 2049er), Pengo,
<br>Wizard of Wor, Berzerk, Missile Command and Centipede are some of the
<br>shining stars among the impressive repertoire of 5200 cartridges.
<br>The latter two are especially enjoyable when played with the optional
<br>Trak-ball controller. For those who are more gamer than collector
<br>and have $125 to burn, he or she can purchase a 5200 multicart from
<br>Sean Kelly. Not only does the multicart contain every released game
<br>in the 5200 library, but virtually every prototype game known to
<br>exist is included as well! And that's a good thing when you consider
<br>that the SuperSystem has an outrageously large amount of prototypes,
<br>some of which are fantastic. (Jr. Pac-Man, Xari Arena, Meebzork,
<br>Millipede and Track and Field come to mind).
<p>Despite its relative small library of games and being a lukewarm
<br>seller in the early 1980s (compared to the 2600), the Atari 5200
<br>has a significant following of die-hard enthusiasts and collectors
<br>who recognize its excellence as a gaming machine. And that, folks,
<br>speaks volumes about a home videogame system that rode off into the
<br>sunset over a decade ago!
<p>1.2 -- DID YOU KNOW?
<br>--------------------
<p>The 5200 was originally conceived as Atari's answer to Mattel's
<br>Intellivision, NOT the Colecovision as many people think. As an
<br>example, the 5200's analog joystick was a response to Mattel touting
<br>its unit having 16 positions of movement compared to the 2600's
<br>eight. Atari's plan was to upstage the Intellivision in this area by
<br>creating an analog controller with 360 degrees of full motion
<br>control.
<p>The 5200 was created at a time when poor marketing and questionable
<br>company policy ran rampant within Atari. The 5200 controller was
<br>developed by an individual who had NEVER even played a single video
<br>game in his life! Response to the controllers from focus groups and
<br>clinics were poor, but the marketing arm stubbornly insisted on
<br>releasing the system with the "groundbreaking" elements intact. In
<br>addition, the controller was partially influenced by corporate policy
<br>where hardware designers and engineers were offered bonuses for
<br>creating designs that received patents. Not surprisingly, many
<br>engineers and designers developed hardware that were innovative
<br>for the sake of being "original", with complete disregard for
<br>functionality.
<p>The engineers were so adamant in their disapproval of the 5200's
<br>controllers that they sent a petition to the director of engineering
<br>in hopes that the non-centering joystick would not be released in its
<br>finished form.
<p>The wedge-shape design of the 5200 was influenced mainly by the 2700
<br>(aka. "RC Stella"), a prototype remote-controlled 2600. Other 2700
<br>design features, such as the side-mounted fire buttons and the non-
<br>self-centering joystick mechanism, carried over to the 5200 design
as
<br>well.
<p>The Atari 3600 (aka. "Silvia") was originally planned as the
<br>successor to the 2600. Silvia's bizarre 10-bit chip set (similar to
<br>the Intellivision) was designed in 1978-79. One must remember that
<br>the shelf life of typical home videogame systems during this period
<br>was generally two years at most, and Atari did not, in its wildest
<br>dreams, foresee the 2600 becoming the awesome videogaming force that
<br>it eventually became. The 3600 was killed by the game programmers
<br>who complained that it was too difficult to program games for the
<br>machine (as if 2600 game development was any cakewalk).
<p>Code names had always been popular at Warner Atari. The VCS was
<br>internally referred to as "Stella," the 400 computer was "Candy," the
<br>800 was "Coleen" and the 5200 was nicknamed "Pam." All of the
<br>aforementioned machines were named after well-endowed female
<br>employees who were working at Atari. The 5200 was unique in that
<br>Atari strongly considered using Pam as the actual name of the unit
<br>before changing it to "Video System X" and eventually deciding on
<br>5200. Why? Because it would have been the abbreviation for
<br>"Personal Arcade Machine."

<p>2.2 -- LABEL/GAME/BOX VARIATIONS
<br>--------------------------------
<p>As far as Atari releases are concerned, there are four main cart
<br>label variations. All Atari-released 5200 carts are similar in that
<br>there is only a front label, and no side or end labels.
<p>1) Games with a copyright of 1982 have a large "ATARI" logo with the
<br>5200 logo beside it. In addition, the trademark information and
<br>copyright dates are on the bottom edge of the front label,
<br>underneath the illustration.
<p>2) Games with a copyright of 1983/84 are similar to the 1982 labels,
<br>with a few exceptions. The "Atari" logo (with the 5200 on the
<br>side) is smaller and is shifted to the top right side of the
<br>label. To the left of the logo, it reads "VIDEO GAME CARTRIDGE"
<br>and "ATARI 5200 SUPERSYSTEM," both with rather small fonts. The
<br>trademark and copyright information is on the left side of the
<br>label.
<p>3) The labels on the 1986 Atari Corporation releases are exactly like
<br>the 1983/84 Atari Inc. carts, but with one MAJOR difference--
<br>the title of the game is not mentioned anywhere on the cart! The
<br>illustration on the label is the only hint of what game the cart
<br>actually is. Of course, the game titles are typed on the front of
<br>the box and on the instruction manual. All Ballblazer and Rescue
<br>on Fractalus carts have this label, and the following titles are
<br>known to have this variation as well (along with the standard 1982
<br>or 1983/84 label):
<p>Space Invaders
<br>Vanguard
<p>4) Another minor variation found on Atari-released 5200 carts are
<br>the grayish labels (as opposed to the normal silver color) in
<br>some of the Atari Corp. releases. The label is dull-gray in
<br>appearance like the ones found in late release 2600 and 7800
<br>carts.
<p>A few other Atari-released label oddities exist. For example,
<br>there is a 1986 release of Dig Dug which has the title on the
<br>cart, which is unlike almost any other 1986 release or re-release.
<p>5) Football was later renamed Realsports Football. The title for
<br>Soccer was also later changed to Realsports Soccer. Differences
<br>in titles and slight alterations in the cart/box art work
<br>notwithstanding, the gameplay for both titles is the same.
<p>Both Bounty Bob Strikes Back and Miner 2049er by Big Five Software
<br>both have two different labels. The more common of the two
<br>variations features a picture label on a red case. A precious few
<br>have a silver foil label with plain text, which is much more
<br>difficult to find than the picture label carts.
<p>Zone Ranger by Activision comes in two flavors. The earlier release
<br>has a regular illustrated label, the type used in all other
<br>Activision games. The later, and more common version (mostly seen
<br>being sold by Telegames) has a silver foil label with black text.
<p>Masterplay Interface by Electra Concepts has two different boxes.
<br>The Masterplay was originally packaged in a small black box with
<br>red pinstripes and no illustration. Later (and more common) units
<br>had larger boxes with pictures and illustrations.
<p>Several late Activision releases for the 5200 have unusual box and
<br>manual variations. Whether it was a result of a cost-cutting
<br>initiative or merely a foul-up on their part, we may never know.
<br>Quite a few of the late releases come in 2600 boxes! Although they
<br>supposedly shipped that way from the factory as brand-new 5200 carts,
<br>the box clearly states "for Atari 2600" and in some cases states
<br>"for Colecovision." Some of these boxes have "for Atari 5200"
<br>stickers pasted on the box over where it originally stated a
<br>different system.
<p>That's not all. Some of the manuals included with the game were
<br>nothing more than photocopies with shrunken down text. Some of the
<br>manuals were also made with instructions for more than one version
of
<br>that particular game (i.e., Pitfall for the 2600, Colecovision and
<br>Atari 5200). Finally, quite a few of the Activision releases had
<br>either manuals for the wrong system or had NO manuals packaged with
<br>the game!

<p>2.4 -- THE BEST AND WORST 5200 GAMES
<br>------------------------------------
<p>5200 gamers were asked to rate each game that they played, in both
<br>graphics and gameplay, on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being best). Below
<br>are the results (ranked in order of their average gameplay scores).
<p>In an attempt to eliminate skew, the high and low scores are dropped
<br>when a game receives enough ratings from contributors.
<p>Only games that have been rated by at least three voters will be
<br>included in the poll. Otherwise, the sampling error would simply be
<br>too large for reliable scores.
<p>If you would like to contribute as a game rater, by all means drop me
<br>a line!

<p>Comments from the Gamers
<br>------------------------
<br>The ratings after each comment are the scores given by that
<br>particular individual.
<p>A "5/4" would stand for Gameplay=4 Graphics=5.
<p>Asteroids
<br>(KI) - It's no wonder Atari canned the game. Sloppy isn't
<br>a brutal enough description of the controls. (1/2)
<p>Astro Chase
<br>(TL) - I don't understand it. What's the point? Graphics are
<br>good though. (score not given)
<p>Ballblazer
<br>(BW) - One of my all time favorites on any platform! (4/5)
<br>(KI) - Split screen, first person perspective and two player
<br>simultaneous gameplay. Who could ask for anything more?
<br>(4/5)
<p>Battlezone (Prototype)
<br>(DM) - How did they manage to make this game so bad? Redefined
<br>character sets made the tanks and obstacles unscalable,
<br>and just made the whole thing look like a bad game you
<br>typed-in on your own 8-bit from Antic magazine or
<br>something. (3/1)
<br>(KI) - No wonder this game was never released. (2/2)
<p>Berzerk
<br>(TL) - This cool game taught me how to fight like a robot
<br>instead of chicken. (4/4)
<br>(EB) - Best home version of this game. Speech is cool! (4/4)
<p>Black Belt
<br>(KI) - A very early and unfinished fighting game. Shows
<br>promise but the lack of collision detection makes it
<br>hard to judge the game. (2/3)
<p>Bounty Bob Strikes Back
<br>(KHe)- All I can say is "WOW!" I thought Miner 2049er was great
<br>(and it still is), but Bounty Bob is king! This game is
<br>incredibly fun AND challenging. It takes the best
<br>elements of Miner, then expands on them. There is so
<br>I like about this game: Lots-o-levels, tons of strategy,
<br>humor, warps, and a special configuration page to boot.
<br>Even the high score entry and display pages are great.
<br>This game is a definite 5/5 for graphics/playability.
<br>Thank you Bill Hogue! (5/5)
<br>(DER)- Game play is really different. Takes all the fun of
<br>Miner 2049er out, sometimes it's hard to tell the
<br>difference between the two except for the different
<br>colors. It's really difficult to jump from one level to
<br>another. I'll say it again; game play is really
<br>difficult. (1/2)
<p>Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom
<br>(DER)- A game I like except I wish they would have taken it
<br>further and made the graphics a bit better a la
<br>Ballblazer. A distant predecessor to games like 1942.
<br>(4/3)
<p>Centipede
<br>(DM) - My 5/5 rating is really based on the fact that this is a
<br>port, it's just a plain good 5200 version. Smooth moving
<br>enemies, fantastic sound, and the trak-ball makes this
<br>probably one of my favorite 5200 titles. (5/5)
<br>(KHe)- Gameplay improves when using trak-ball.
<br>(EB) - Different from (and better than) the Atari 8-bit Computer
<br>version. (4/3)
<br>(JJ) - Beats Atari Computer version by a mile. (5/5)
<p>Congo Bongo
<br>(JT) - Hate this damn game. Cheezy 3-D perspective doesn't work
<br>at all. (1/2)
<br>(DER)- It's an OK game. I liked playing it in the arcade, but
<br>the 5200 version is kinda lame. The opening level seems
<br>like a big splotch of yellow with some brown added to it.
<br>(3/3)
<br>(EB) - Awful, just awful. (1/2)
<p>Countermeasure
<br>(TL) - The 5200's version of Combat. (4/2)
<p>Decathlon
<br>(KI) - If you want to kill your joystick by playing this game,
<br>be my guest. Don't say that I didn't warn you, though.
<br>Decent enough game for those who don't mind the risk of
<br>thrashing their controllers. (2/4)
<p>Defender
<br>(DER)- I consider this game the "feel-good" game of the Atari
<br>series. It seems no matter how bad you are playing, you
<br>can always rack up a high score. I like Defender a lot,
<br>it's one of my all-time faves. (5/3)
<br>(TL) - Not a big fan of the game but the graphics are
<br>outstanding! (3/5)
<br>(KI) - Smooth gameplay coupled with the absence of flicker
<br>(unlike the 2600 version) combine to make this one of
<br>the most faithful ports of Defender on any classic
<br>system. (4/4)
<p>Dig Dug
<br>(DER)- I've seen better ports of this than the 5200 version, but
<br>there's something about Dig Dug I like that I can't put a
<br>finger on. An entertaining game. (3/3)
<p>Final Legacy
<br>(KI) - None of the sub-games is good enough to stand on its own,
<br>but judged as a whole it's slightly more enjoyable than
<br>Countermeasure. (3/4)
<p>Frogger
<br>(JT) - Friggin' retarded control scheme. (2/5)
<br>(TL) - What a sissy concept for a game. (2/3)
<br>(KHe)- Looks good, but button/joystick combo that you have to
<br>use to control Frogger's movement is a pain. Keypad
<br>controlling is even worse. (2/4)
<br>(KI) - Play this game with the Masterplay and you'll change your
<br>mind, guys :) (4/4)
<p>Frogger II: Threeedeep!
<br>(DER)- I like this game a lot. One of the last games I got
<br>before they became impossible to get. As a matter of
<br>fact, this game IS impossible to get. I like the
<br>graphics and it's a big improvement over the first one.
<br>(4/4)
<br>(KI) - Great sequel, but this game is bound to frustrate even
<br>the best gamers with its absurd difficulty. (4/4)
<p>Galaxian
<br>(BW) - Looks and plays like Galaxian, but just lacks something.
<br>(4/3)
<br>(DER)- This game is haunted by the fact that the game play and
<br>screens never change. (See also Space Invaders). I like
<br>this better than Space Invaders, however. (3/3)
<p>Gorf
<br>(TL) - I can't give it a 5/5 because they forgot the Galaxian
<br>level. Otherwise it is awesome! (4/5)
<p>Gyruss
<br>(JT) - Fantastic music. (4/5)
<br>(KI) - Along with Ballblazer, Pengo and Moon Patrol, this game
<br>is a showcase title of the 5200's remarkable audio
<br>capabilities. (4/3)
<p>James Bond 007
<br>(KI) - An insanely difficult game, and an awful one to boot.
<br>(2/3)
<p>Joust
<br>(KI) - A faithful home port of the Williams coin-op. (4/4)
<p>Jungle Hunt
<br>(KHe)- Is it just me or is the final scene much more difficult
<br>than in the original coin-op? (3/4)
<br>(KI) - Most people either love this game or despise it. I'm
<br>somewhere in between, however. (3/4)
<p>K-Razy Shootout
<br>(KI) - A decent ripoff of Berzerk on a system that already has
<br>an (almost) pixel perfect port of the real thing. (3/2)
<p>Kaboom!
<br>(DM) - Although many people believe playing Kaboom! without a
<br>paddle is some kind of sacrilege, I love this version of
<br>the game. With the 5200 joystick, you're simply
<br>controlling the same potentiometer in the controller, but
<br>with a knob on the 2600 and a stick on the 5200. Output
<br>is analog either way. Plus, the 1812 Overture really
<br>gets me pumped up! (5/4)
<br>(KI) - The option of allowing a second player to play as the Mad
<br>Bomber is a cool feature not found in any other version
<br>of Kaboom! (4/3)
<p>Kangaroo
<br>(TL) - This game is downright stupid. The graphics are even
<br>worse. I bet they had Commodore shaking in their boots
<br>at the time. (1/1)
<br>(KI) - Controlling Mama-roo is tricky with the standard 5200
<br>joystick, but this game truly shines for those lucky
<br>enough to have a third-party controller. (4/4)
<p>Mario Bros.
<br>(KHe)- Great port. Fun, especially with two players. (5/4)
<p>Megamania
<br>(TL) - Cool graphics, but redundant as #@$%. (3/4)
<br>(DM) - I love this game. Apart from the fact that this game
<br>just feels a little different from the 2600 version that
<br>we're all used to, this game is terrific in every way.
<br>And aside from the game, the label and box art are quite
<br>superior to its 2600 counterpart. If this one had come
<br>out first, they would have laughed the 2600 version out
<br>the door. (5/5)
<p>Meteorites
<br>(KI) - A pretty decent Asteroids clone. Speaking of which,
<br>whatever happened to Asteroids??? (4/3)
<p>Micro-gammon SB (Prototype)
<br>(DM) - I'm glad they used the highest resolution possible for at
<br>least one game. The computer may not be a very good
<br>backgammon player, but they really had a great idea here
<br>and I'm sorry it wasn't released. (3/5)
<p>Millipede (Prototype)
<br>(KI) - Absolutely phenomenal. The trak-ball option puts this
<br>version above the technically superior NES edition. (5/4)
<p>Miner 2049er
<br>(DER)- This game is everything that BBSB isn't. Easy to play,
<br>not too difficult, OK graphics, just a lot of fun. (4/2)
<br>(KHe)- Great game! Was my favorite as a kid. (5/5)
<p>Missile Command
<br>(TL) - This game has it all! Easily my favorite 5200 game and
<br>among my favorites of all time. Anyone have a trak-ball
<br>for sale? (5/5)
<br>(DM) - With two buttons and a keypad available, having only one
<br>missile base is inexcusable. They even fit two bases
<br>into the Atari ST version, using each button on the
<br>mouse. Why couldn't Atari port their own game worth a
<br>"bleep"? (2/3)
<p>Mountain King
<br>(KHe)- Fun; are the higher levels winnable? (5/3)
<p>Mr. Do's Castle
<br>(DM) - After seeing the Colecovision version, this is just plain
<br>sad. The 5200 could certainly have moved the Do-meister
<br>and the Chameleon Unicorns around better than it did.
<br>(3/2)
<p>Ms. Pac-Man
<br>(DER)- The successor to Pac-Man is more challenging than the
<br>original, and gameplay is better. (4/3)
<p>Pac-Man
<br>(TL) - The screen is just too wide. And what happened to the
<br>great sound effects that were included in the 2600
<br>version? (3/2)
<p>Pengo
<br>(KHe)- Fun! I liked the arcade game, but wasn't too good at it.
<br>Played this version a lot! Great port (5/3)
<br>(KI) - A pixel perfect port of the coin-op cult classic. (4/5)
<p>Pitfall!
<br>(BW) - I actually like 2600 Pitfall better! (3/3)
<p>Pitfall II: Lost Caverns
<br>(KI) - For an additional challenge, try the secret Adventurer's
<br>world! (5/4)
<p>Pole Position
<br>(BW) - Made me want a 5200 back in the day (4/4)
<p>Popeye
<br>(TL) - Graphics leave a bit to be desired. (3/2)
<br>(KI) - Never cared for Nintendo's coin-op version, so the 5200
<br>one doesn't do much for me. (3/3)
<p>Q*Bert
<br>(JT) - Retarded controls (like Frogger). (2/4)
<br>(KHe)- Not one of my favorite games, but seems to be a good
<br>port. Of course, it's missing the "thwack" of the
<br>original when Q*bert or Coily jumps off the side of the
<br>pyramid. (3/3)
<p>Qix
<br>(TL) - A true classic. Decent graphics. Great concept! One of
<br>the best ever! (5/5)
<p>RealSports Baseball
<br>(DER)- This game is fun! I like playing the higher levels,
<br>because the easy level is too easy. On the easy level,
<br>you can bunt for home runs. The voice in the game is
<br>cool, but can get old after a long time of playing. (4/4)
<p>RealSports Basketball (Prototype)
<br>(DER)- I played this game for two weeks as part of an Atari
<br>survey my Dad got in '83 in the Northwest suburbs of
<br>Chicago. The graphics were terrible and the gameplay
<br>wasn't too much better. I suppose it would have been
<br>better if I had really good joysticks, or that I should
<br>have played it on the two-port version. (2/2)
<p>RealSports Football
<br>(DER)- This game is just above average. The playbooks are cool,
<br>but I can run the same play over and over again and
<br>demolish the computer. I don't understand how a player
<br>can run around the screen and end up on the other side.
<br>(2/2)
<p>RealSports Soccer
<br>(DER)- I'm a big fan of Soccer, and this game is an OK version.
<br>It seems that most of the time the other players are out
<br>just wandering around. (3/2)
<p>Rescue on Fractalus
<br>(KI) - The system of fractile geometry which was used to
<br>generate the planetary landscape was a gaming first.
<br>(5/5)
<p>River Raid
<br>(BW) - I don't like the jagged river edges, and the stick ruins
<br>it for me. (4/3)
<p>Space Dungeon
<br>(TL) - Berzerk in outer space with a little more meat in it.
<br>(4/4)
<br>(JJ) - Simply put, this game rules! (5/5)
<br>(KI) - Robotron meets Berzerk meets Zelda. A closet classic
<br>that begs to be played by everyone. (5/5)
<p>Space Invaders
<br>(DER)- I know it's an older game, but Galaxian and Megamania
<br>picked up where this one left off. Gameplay is OK and
<br>graphics are weak, but that's what it's like to be an
<br>original. (2/2)
<br>(KHe)- Not really like the original but kind of fun. The mother
<br>ship comes out constantly! (3/3)
<p>Star Raiders
<br>(BW) - Great, even with the 5200 stick! (5/5)
<br>(DER)- Predecessor to X-Wing and Wing Commander. Really
<br>involved for a 5200 game. It had one of the largest
<br>manuals for any game, 40-some pages. (5/3)
<br>(KHe)- I guess this is considered to be a "classic," but I just
<br>can't get into this game. Yuck! (1/1)
<p>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator
<br>(EB) - Boring translation of a game that has no good home ports
<br>(vector to raster). (2/3)
<p>Star Wars: The Arcade Game
<br>(DM) - After this guy got fired from Atari for Battlezone, he
<br>must have went to Parker Brothers. Same crappy blocky
<br>Battlezone graphics ruined this one too. (3/2)
<br>(KI) - It (sort of) looks like the arcade version, and it sure
<br>sounds like it, too. But it plays nothing like its
<br>color vector parent. (2/3)
<p>Super Breakout
<br>(KHo)- The 2600 version blows this one out of the water! (1/1)
<br>(BW) - How do you rate graphics on Breakout? Of course they're
<br>blocky. (3/4)
<p>Super Pac-Man
<br>(KI) - Absolutely superb. The graphics are sharp and colorful,
<br>and everything that was found in the coin-op original is
<br>featured in the SuperSystem adaptation. (5/5)
<p>Tempest
<br>(KI) - Incomplete, but what's there shows tremendous promise.
<br>Control is spot-on, and the sound effects seem to have
<br>been taken straight out of the arcade version. (4/5)
<p>Vanguard
<br>(TL) - I liked the 2600 version better but credit is due for a
<br>great game like Vanguard. (3/5)
<br>(KHe)- Captures the spirit of the original. Sadly, the four
<br>fire button arrangement of the coin-op couldn't be
<br>duplicated. I hate how the ship doesn't move easily
<br>while firing. (3/3)
<p>Wizard of Wor
<br>(TL) - Cool game. Decent graphics. (4/4)
<p>Xari Arena (Prototype)
<br>(DM) - Good marks just based on originality. What a nifty game
<br>this was. (5/4)
<br>(KI) - If you liked Warlords, you'll absolutely love this
<br>prototype game. (4/3)
<p>Zaxxon
<br>(KHo)- Blows away the Colecovision and C-64 versions by a mile!
<br>(5/5)
<p>Zone Ranger
<br>(TL) - Playability is awesome. (4/4)
<p>2.5 -- GENERAL SOFTWARE INFO, TIDBITS, CHEATS AND EASTER EGGS
<br>-------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Adventure
<br>A box for this game was shown in a flyer for the "Video
<br>System X."
<p>A.E.
<br>An unreleased prototype that is similar to the Atari computer
<br>version, one was recently auctioned off by Best Electronics.
<br>Only a precious few are known to exist.
<p>Asteroids
<br>Recently discovered! The first Atari 5200 catalog
<br>(Part #CO18270 Rev.1) shows a picture of the box as well as a
<br>game description and screenshot. This game supports up to 4
<br>players in head-to-head or cooperative play. After attempting
<br>to play it, you realize what weve all suspected for some time:
<br>The game is unplayable with the standard 5200 controller. Some
<br>interesting notes - This cart was found with an actual
<br>production label and a prototype 5200 Asteroids controller.
<br>Only one is known to exist, and was demonstrated for the first
<br>time at the World of Atari '98 show in Las Vegas. For more
<br>info on this game - including screenshots - check out
<br>Atari Gaming Headquarters (http://www.atarihq.com).
<p>Astrochase
<br>Licensed from First Star Software. Designed by Fernando
<br>Herrera, founder of First Star Software. An interesting note
<br>on the origin of this company - Atari had a program called the
<br>Atari Program Exchange (APX) which published user-written
<br>software for their 8-bit line of computers. The submission that
<br>was judged best by Atari each year was awarded the Atari Star
<br>award. Fernando Herrera wrote a program called "My First
<br>Alphabet" which was selected as the first-ever winner of the
<br>Atari Star Award; hence the name: First Star Software.
<p>Ballblazer
<br>Designed and programmed by David Levine, Peter Langston, David
<br>Riordan, and Garry Hare. Contributions and support by Charlie
<br>Kellner, Gary Winnick, and David Fox. According to sources at
<br>Atari, the working title for this game was "Topsy Turvy". One
<br>of only two Atari released games that came in a white box
<br>(Rescue on Fractalus was the other) instead of the standard
<br>issue grey and blue box. This game is also one of the few Atari
<br>titles that has no name on the cartridge label. Also one of the
<br>first games musically scored by a recognized musician, Pat
<br>Methany.
<p>Bar Room Baseball
<br>This version of RealSports Baseball has been modified and was
<br>intended for use in an arcade cabinet. The inclusion of a
<br>timer limited gameplay to 3 minutes per credit. Arcade cabinets
<br>with 5200 systems inside were sold in Mexico and other Latin
<br>American countries.
<p>Battlezone
<br>This version resorted to colorful backgrounds instead of the
<br>arcade vector graphics. Has a 2 joystick option and most
<br>likely would have been packaged with a controller holder like
<br>Robotron and Space Dungeon.
<p>Beamrider
<br>Designed by Dave Rolfe. 5200 adaptation by Action Graphics.
<br>Reaching sector 14 with 40,000 points or more got you a
<br>Beamriders patch if you sent Activision picture proof and $1.
<br>This and several other 5200 titles from Activision were later
<br>packaged in 2600 boxes with stickers on them.
<p>Behind Jaggi Lines
<br>Working title for Rescue on Fractalus, Behind Jaggi Lines was
<br>recently discovered and demonstrated for the first time at
<br>World of Atari '98 in Las Vegas. An exact duplicate of Rescue
<br>except for the different title on the title screen.
<p>Berzerk
<br>The first console game that had built-in voice synthesis without
<br>the need of additional hardware, 5200 Berzerk is a marvelous
<br>translation of the coin-op original. Highly recommended,
<br>particularly if you like to be taunted by Evil Otto with phrases
<br>like "Chicken, fight like a robot!"
<p>An interesting glitch exists that allows a player to make Evil
<br>Otto (that's the official name of "Mr. Happy") go the opposite
<br>direction from where you are on the screen, but this works only
<br>on the left exit. Position your character until he's just about
<br>to exit the maze (that is, the next joystick movement to the
<br>left will make him leave the maze). Evil Otto will start to
<br>bounce towards the right instead of coming after you. If you
<br>stand at the exit long enough, Evil Otto will wrap around to the
<br>left side of the screen. Whether he kills you when he touches
<br>you is uncertain; the wrap-around scenario has not been tested
<br>as of yet. This glitch is extremely useful, especially when you
<br>want to finish off the robots and Evil Otto comes in sooner than
<br>you anticipate. It takes practice to precisely position your
<br>character to make Evil Otto go the other way, but you'll get it
<br>right with practice.
<p>Another tip that can help in mastering the game has to do with
<br>your character's neck. Or should I say lack thereof? The open
<br>space below his head can be useful when facing robots straight
<br>to your left or right. If you position the character just
<br>right, the robot's lasers will go right through without killing
<br>him It's very tough to master, especially on higher levels when
<br>the lasers are traveling at the same speed that yours do.
<p>And last but not least, it's easier to avoid Evil Otto by going
<br>to the left or right exits than using the top or bottom ones.
<br>This is due to how Evil Otto bounces when he chances you. Of
<br>course, there will be times that the top or bottom exits will be
<br>your best retreat.
<p>Black Belt
<br>Similar to Karateka, Black Belt was to be Ataris entry into
<br>the karate genre. Impressive graphics, with several different
<br>rooms. No collision detection and slow movement/gameplay keep
<br>this one from being complete. This title probably evolved from
<br>a title in the rumor mill called "Martial Arts".
<br>For more info on this game - including screenshots - check out
<br>Atari Gaming Headquarters (http://www.atarihq.com).
<p>Boogie Demo Cart
<br>It's difficult to tell if this one is anything more than
<br>someone at Atari "screwing around" or if there was an eventual
<br>purpose to this title. Not really a game, this music demo plays
<br>a repeating Boogie tune. Only a precious few are known to
<br>exist.
<p>Bounty Bob Strikes Back
<br>Designed and programmed by Bill Hogue, founder of Big 5
<br>Software. Graphics designed by Curtis Mikolyski. A sequel
<br>that's better than the original? You bet! A follow-up to Miner
<br>2049'er that could be the most enjoyable game ever made. The
<br>box for this game is extremely hard to come by, as is the full
<br>color poster that was packed in.
<p>To transport to another screen, grab the item mentioned below,
<br>then press and hold the number (also stated below) then press
<br>start. You will warp to the level mentioned.
<p>1. Bob's Morning Flower pot / 1 / start = level 4
<br>Calisthenics
<br>2. Utility Hoist Aliens / paint roller / 3 / start = level 22
<br>3. The Suction Tubes Goblet / 4 / start = level 15
<br>5. Jumping 101 Coffee Pot / 8 / start = level 18
<br>10. The Gravity Lift Pitch Fork / 5 / start = level 14
<br>16. Adv. Suction Tubes Tube 1 to left/ pie / 9 / start = level 19
<p>26. The End......
<br>"Congratulations, you are an expert! For getting this far, you
<br>may start the game at any level you desire by setting special
<br>codes 1-25 in the Game Adjustment Screen and then pressing
<br>START."
<p>At the game adjustment screen, enter one of the following
<br>special codes and press * for a few secret messages:
<p>5 6 49 69 100 213 666 782 818 2049 6861
<p>Centipede (released version)
<br>Atari 5200 version designed by Frank Hausman and Sean W.
<br>Hennessy. One of the many games that is trak-ball compatible.
<br>Named the best game (covering all systems), best 5200 game and
<br>best graphics in a 5200 game in the first annual Videogame
<br>Illustrated "Vista Awards."
<p>Centipede, ("Killer hard version")
<br>Recently discovered, this particular prototype is similar to the
<br>released version of the same game, with the exception being that
<br>it's HARD! (as if the released version was a walk in the park to
<br>begin with). The Centipedes slide down the screen at a frantic
<br>pace, and the spiders have even better AI along with faster
<br>movement. Definitely an in-house "pet" project and never
<br>intended for release.
<p>Choplifter!
<br>Based on the Broderbund computer game designed by Dan Gorlin.
<br>The copyright on the back of the box has a printing error -
<br>1982 Dan Gorling. I'm sure Mr. Gorlin was thrilled. One of
<br>the last games released for the 5200.
<p>Cloak and Dagger
<br>Announced by Atari but never released. In the movie of the same
<br>name, the kid from ET can be seen holding a 5200 Cloak &amp; Dagger
<br>cartridge (most likely just a mock-up). For further details
<br>surrounding the Cloak and Dagger mystery, see Section 2.6 of
<br>this FAQ.
<p>Congo Bongo
<br>Based on the Sega coin-op. The manual incorrectly claims that
<br>after selecting 1 or 2 players, the game will ask you whether
<br>or not you're using a joystick. Needless to say, no controller
<br>choices are given, although we're at a loss as to what choices
<br>they had in mind. As with most other versions of this game,
<br>only 2 of the 4 arcade version screens are present.
<p>Countermeasure
<br>An early prototype of this game has the name Failsafe
<br>although the game appears to be identical. One of a few games
<br>that never appeared on any other Atari system. Note the Atari
<br>symbol on the soldier's cap on the game box/cart picture. The
<br>failsafe code was a combination of the following letters: L, E,
<br>O. You have to wonder what the programmer's name or sign was...
<p>Here's an interesting easter egg... When the skull and
<br>crossbones appears, after you fail to enter the correct code,
<br>take a look at one of the bones.&nbsp; You'll see the initials "RM,"
<br>which is initials of the programmer.
<p>Cram Cartridge
<br>Cram is a nickname for the in-house version of the Atari 5200
<br>Diagnostic Cartridge. Basically, it is a diagnostic cart that
<br>has pin #18 shorted to Ground, which forces the 5200 to turn
<br>on automatically when the cart is inserted. These carts were
<br>used for assembly line testing where employees would CRAM the
<br>cart into the machine to make sure they powered up and were
<br>functioning. Actually, any cartridge can be made into a Cram
<br>cart by shorting pin #18 as mentioned above.
<p>Decathlon
<br>Designed by David Crane. 5200 adaptation by Paul Willson.
<br>Scoring over 8,600 points could get you a "Bronze" patch,
<br>over 9,000 a "Silver" patch, and over 10,000 a "Gold" patch
<br>by sending proof to Activision along with $1.
<p>Defender
<br>Programmed by Steve Baker. One of the many games that is
<br>trak-ball compatible. Note the Atari symbol in the building's
<br>window at the top-left of the game box/instructions/cart
<br>picture.
<p>Second runner-up in the best 5200 game category in the first
<br>annual Videogaming Illustrated "Vista Awards."
<p>Diagnostic Cartridge
<br>Used by factory authorized service personnel to diagnose
<br>malfunctioning systems. Selections included tests for RAM,
<br>ROM, Video, Sound, Joystick Ports, Joysticks, along with the
<br>ability to examine memory locations. Several revisions exist.
<p>Dig Dug
<br>The 1986 Atari Corp. release has a label variation. The "5200"
<br>at the top of the cart is printed in an elongated font. The
<br>"vegetable"? for rounds 16 &amp; 17 is a Galaxian.
<p>Dreadnaught Factor, The
<br>Designed by Tom Loughry. 5200 adaptation by Eric Nickell.
<br>Defeating the entire fleet of Dreadnaughts on level 4 or higher
<br>could net you a Dreadnaught Destroyer patch if you sent
<br>Activision a picture of your TV screen (you didnt have to
<br>include $1 for this one).
<p>Fail Safe
<br>This was one of the working names for Countermeasure. The game
<br>is identical except for the name.
<p>Final Legacy
<br>Recently discovered and demonstrated for the first time at
<br>World of Atari '98 in Las Vegas. Nearly identical to the
<br>Atari computer version.
<br>There were two versions of this game for the Atari 8-bit
<br>computers. One had text for in-game selections while the other
<br>used icons. This version uses text, probably since the 5200
<br>wasnt exactly an international success. Seems complete.
<br>For more info on this game - including screenshots - check out
<br>Atari Gaming Headquarters (http://www.atarihq.com).
<p>Football
<br>Designed and implemented by Jim Huether, who years later also
<br>designed the Sega Genesis game "Joe Montana's Sportstalk
<br>Football". One of the many games that is trak-ball compatible.
<br>Originally just called "Football", Atari changed the name to
<br>fit their RealSports line-up.
<p>Score 199 points or more without allowing the other team to
<br>score more than 3 during a practice game in regulation time.
<br>You must also score the last touchdown with no time left.
<br>Instead of seeing the usual "Game Over" message you will see
<br>"DESIGNED BY THE WARLORD" on your screen.
<p>Football (for Video System X)
<br>Photos of this game, along with the Video System X (working
<br>title of the 5200) were shown at trade shows and in magazines
<br>before the 5200 was eventually released. The cart had a
<br>completely different label from 5200 Football, and it is not
<br>known whether this game is any different from the 5200 version
<br>(or if it was just a cart shell mockup, for that matter).
<p>Frisky Tom
<br>An unreleased game based on the coin-op by Nichibutsu, this
<br>game seems complete and is very playable. It even has the girl
<br>in the bath-tub. Frisky Tom pretty much popped out of nowhere.
<br>It was never mentioned in any magazines or literature and
<br>until it was found with several other protos, no-one even knew
<br>it existed. Only a precious few are known to exist.
<p>Frogger
<br>Players have the option of using the keypad buttons to control
<br>the direction of Frogger's movement. Press button #2 to hop
<br>Frogger forward, #8 to hop back, #4 to go left and #6 to go
<br>right.
<p>Frogger II: Threeedeep!
<br>Three distinctly different screens take Frogger on another
<br>homeward-bound journey, but this time it's underwater, over
<br>water, and through the air. As in Frogger, the player can
<br>choose to use the keypad buttons to control Frogger.
<p>Galaxian
<br>The manual mentions that after wave 10, the Galaxian fleet
<br>may surprise you with some special screen graphics. The only
<br>thing we've ever seen is sometimes when you destroy a Galaxian,
<br>an Atari symbol will flash briefly in the explosion.
<p>Gorf
<br>Programmed by Roklan Corp.
<p>Gremlins
<br>Designed and programmed by John Seghers. Animation by Courtney
<br>Granner. Sound by Robert Vieira. This game is completely
<br>different from the 2600 version.
<p>Gyruss
<br>Licensed from Konami. The game music is Johann Sebastian
<br>Bach's "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor".
<p>H.E.R.O.
<br>Designed by John Van Ryzin. 5200 adaptation by The Softworks.
<br>H.E.R.O. stands for Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation.
<br>Scoring over 70,000 points got you an "Order of the H.E.R.O."
<br>patch by sending proof to Activision along with $1.
<p>James Bond 007
<br>Contains 4 movie scenarios: Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who
<br>Loved Me, Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only.
<p>Jr. Pac-Man
<br>The game appears complete, but it was not released commercially.
<p>An absolutely phenomenal conversion of the coin-op. Smooth
<br>scrolling and crisp sounds make this the best of the three Pac's
<br>in the 5200 library.
<p>Jungle River Cruise
<br>Designed for Atari's unreleased "Puffer" exercise bicycle, a
<br>prototype version of this game has recently been discovered.
<br>Formerly titled 'Riverboat' and 'River Rescue'.
<p>Kaboom!
<br>Designed by Larry Kaplan. 5200 adaptation by Paul Willson.
<br>The SuperSystem version is similar to the 2600 edition, but the
<br>former has an added feature of allowing two players to take
<br>turns playing the Mad Bomber (dropping the bombs), and catching
<br>the bombs with the buckets. By Paul Wilson.
<p>By scoring 1800 or more points in 1 player mode and sending in a
<br>picture of the score, players were awarded the Bucket Brigade
<br>Patch from Activision.
<p>Keystone Kapers
<br>Designed by Garry Kitchen. 5200 adaptation by Alex DeMeo.
<p>Krull
<br>Announced but never released. Only a prototype box of this game
<br>is known to exist. Furthermore, this box shares the same color
<br>scheme as the 2600 version of the same name, and even the "CX"
<br>number on the box is identical to the regular 2600 box
<br>(CX 2682).
<p>Last Starfighter, The
<br>Programmed by Gary Stark. This title went through a name change
<br>and became Star Raiders 2; only seeing release for the Atari
<br>8-bit line of computers. Apparently, Atari purchased the rights
<br>but decided a sequel to Star Raiders would be better embraced
<br>by the masses. Also, it is possible that this title began its
<br>life as a game called "Orbiter". The game seems complete except
<br>for the lack of shields.
<p>Loco-motion
<br>Mattel had at least the Intellivision rights to this game, but
<br>a prototype box of this game from Atari exists. No word on
<br>whether a prototype cart exists at all.
<p>Looney Tunes Hotel
<br>Utilizing the Warner Bros. cartoon licenses, this game
<br>featured Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and Devil
<br>(Tasmanian, we assume). The game seems to be in the early to
<br>middle stages of development. You control Bugs as he tries to
<br>get the carrots while avoiding the bombs, etc.
<p>Meebzork
<br>An adventure game for the 5200 with 6 stages of fun. This proto
<br>still has a few bugs that cause screen freezes and blackouts.
<br>Also, the game requires some precise movements which is almost
<br>impossible with the standard 5200 stick. Graphics aren't bad
<br>and include a nice 3-D effect on the Phoenix stage.
<p>Megamania
<br>Designed by Steve Cartwright. 5200 adaptation by Glyn Anderson.
<br>Activision would send you an official MegaManiacs emblem if you
<br>sent them proof that you scored 45,000 points or more.
<p>Meteorites
<br>Now here's an interesting tidbit. The working title of this
<br>Asteroids clone during its development stage was 'Disasteroids'!
<br>However, when Atari learned of the name upon visiting Electra
<br>Concepts' booth at the 1983 Summer Consumer Electronics Show,
<br>they quickly threatened to sue unless Electra changed the game
<br>title. Both Meteorites and the Masterplay Interface are
<br>sometimes listed as being made by a company called Intellicon.
<br>In actuality, Intellicon was nothing more than a mail-order
<br>company that bought and sold off the remaining inventory from
<br>Electra Concepts.
<p>Micro-gammon SB
<br>Programmed by Steve Baker. A nice backgammon game for the
<br>5200. This game uses the keypad and fire buttons only; no
<br>joystick. The SB stands for Super Brain (not Steve Baker) and
<br>is one of the IQ settings for the computer opponent The game
<br>seems essentially complete.
<p>Millipede
<br>Complete. Exceptional port of the coin-op hit. Especially fun
<br>when played with the trak-ball.
<p>Miner 2049er
<br>Programmed by Bill Hogue. Graphics and Audio Visual Displays
<br>designed by Curtis Mikolyski and Bill Hogue with Jeff Konyu and
<br>Kelly Bakst. Circuitry designed by Bill Hogue. Package Artwork
<br>by Scott Ross.
<p>Start a zone. Jump onto the first platform and position Bounty
<br>Bob so that no creatures will touch him (do NOT pause game).
<br>Hold the UPPER red fire button down while entering Big Five's
<br>phone number (2137826861) on the keypad. You will know you did
<br>it right because it will immediately restart the zone again when
<br>you enter the last digit of the phone number.
<p>Congratulations, you now have a way to "warp" to any zone or
<br>station in the game!
<p>HOW TO USE IT
<p>Push the reset button on the joystick and select 1-0 on the
<br>keypad for the zone you want to play.
<br>(1=zone 1, 2=zone 2, ... 0=zone 10).
<br>Now, hold the upper red button down while pressing 1-0 on the
<br>keypad. This will allow you to select which station to play.
<br>You will immediately warp to the selected station! The warping
<br>ability will work at *ANY* time during the game! This is
<br>extremely useful for getting "unlimited" lives. (HINT: If you
<br>die on a level and IMMEDIATELY warp Bounty Bob, the game will
<br>keep track of your score, but won't take away a life!)
<p>NOTES: Miner is great fun at the difficult levels. Some levels
<br>are NOT clearable. After lots of playing, the following levels
<br>have been found to be possible to clear.
<p>ZONE STATION
<br>---- -------
<br>1-8 ALL
<br>9 1-9
<br>10 1-4, 8, 9
<p>Zone 8/station 10 is the hardest, but IS possible.
<br>Zone 10/station 4 requires a lot of thinking/strategy to clear.
<br>Try it, it's fun!
<p>For some reason on Zone 10, Bounty Bob walks very fast and jumps
<br>a LOOONG way. This makes certain levels difficult and others
<br>impossible. However, on Zone 10/station 10, the creatures just
<br>move too fast to make it possible to clear. It's a shame, we
<br>will always be left wondering what would happen if it had been
<br>cleared.
<p>Miniature Golf
<br>Programmed by Steve Baker. Looks to be complete. So-so
<br>graphics, with 18 holes and varying layouts. What's there is
<br>quite impressive.
<p>Mountain King
<br>Designed by E.F. Dryer.
<p>When first starting Mountain King, let it go through the
<br>"opening demonstration" where the MK guy jumps/dances to the
<br>music and eventually jumps to the top of the hill where the
<br>flame is. Once the "show" ends, maneuver the guy to the very
<br>bottom where the spider's "cave" is. Stand on top of where the
<br>spider comes out. Make the MK guy (does he have a name?) stand
<br>on the far right of the cave so that he is mostly balancing in
<br>mid-air with only his left foot barely touching the top of the
<br>cave. (See diagram 1... hopefully it will look right when viewed
<br>on your computer.)
<p>(1) (2)
<br>0 &lt;-- MK guy
<br>-|-
<br>/ \
<br>----------- ______________ 0
<br>spider _ _ -|-
<br>cave _ _/ \
<br>_ _
<br>__________________________ _____________________________
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Ok, once you have him in position, pull down briefly/slightly
<br>(like you were going to make him squat) on the joystick once or
<br>twice and the guy should walk PART WAY DOWN the side of the cave
<br>and "hang" there. If he goes all the way to the floor, then try
<br>it again. (See diagram 2.)
<p>Now walk to the left. He should fall through/into the cave.
<br>Keep going left... you might have to jump to the left to get him
<br>to fall THROUGH the bottom of the screen. As you are falling,
<br>you should see a special message that tells who programmed the
<br>game!
<p>NOTES: When you do this, there is no way back out. Actually, I
<br>think you can catch on fire and die. :) This doesn't work right
<br>if you don't let the game do the demonstration/music sequence at
<br>the beginning.
<p>Ms. Pac-Man ("Puffer" Edition)
<br>Designed for Atari's unreleased "Puffer" exercise bicycle, this
<br>game was never planned for release. It was only developed for
<br>internal testing purposes as an example of a type of game that
<br>was not well-suited for the Puffer.
<p>Pac-Man
<br>This version includes the arcade intermissions. The Galaxian
<br>bonus item in the arcade version has been replaced with an Atari
<br>logo. Pac-man later replaced Super Breakout as the pack-in game
<br>for the 5200.
<p>On the Cherry screen, take off to the right and head straight up
<br>and into the right-hand tunnel. As you go off-screen, you'll
<br>hear a chomp. Pause the game and examine the dots to the left
<br>of the starting point. You'll find a missing dot.
<p>On the fifth key round, the ghosts start flashing immediately
<br>after Pac eats a power pellet, and they don't stop. Unless Pac
<br>eats them, they stay in a vulnerable state for the entire round.
<br>It doesn't happen in the sixth key round (after the
<br>intermission), but does for the seventh key and beyond. You
<br>have to be pretty stupid to die accidentally from there on.
<p>Named first runner up in the best 5200 game category and best
<br>arcade adaptation (all systems) in the first annual Videogaming
<br>Illustrated "Vista" awards.
<p>Pengo
<br>Programmed by Sean W. Hennessy.
<p>Pete's Test Cartridge
<br>Recently discovered, this system utility essentially tests for
<br>defects in key areas. Using a standard 5200 controller to select
<br>various options, you can test for brightness (or dimness), color
<br>balance, color contrast and joystick calibration, among other
<br>things. And no, we have no idea who Pete is.

<p>Pitfall!
<br>Designed by David Crane. 5200 adaptation by Beck-Tech. Scoring
<br>over 20,000 points could get you an "Explorer's Club" patch by
<br>sending proof to Activision.
<p>Pitfall II: Lost Caverns
<br>Designed by David Crane. 5200 Adventurer's Edition by Mike
<br>Lorenzen. What makes this version The Adventurer's Edition?
<br>The fact that once you completed the game, you could play a
<br>second, even more difficult mission, with a completely
<br>different maze (Write us for a layout). Scoring over 99,000
<br>points could get you a "Cliff Hangers" patch by sending proof
<br>to Activision along with $1.
<p>Popeye
<br>This game came with a scratch-off "Spinach Can Game" card which
<br>gave you a chance to win a full size Popeye Arcade game or a
<br>Popeye T-shirt.
<p>Missing the Sea Hag found in level 3 of the coin-op.
<p>Pole Position ("Puffer" Edition)
<br>Designed for Atari's unreleased "Puffer" exercise bicycle.
<br>Unlike Jungle River Cruise and Tumbleweeds, however, a prototype
<br>version of this game has not (yet) been uncovered.
<p>Pursuit of the Pink Panther.
<br>Originally slated for an early 1984 release, the lack of
<br>adequate supplies of ROM chips was blamed by Probe 2000 as the
<br>reason for the cancellation of the game. 2600 and Colecovision
<br>editions were also announced but they too never saw the light of
<br>day.
<p>Q*Bert
<br>Invisible Pyramid -- On the first screen, hop down four squares
<br>and onto the disc. As soon as the disc turns yellow, press
<br>PAUSE and then the START key to start the game over. Keep
<br>pressing the HOP button the whole time you are doing this. When
<br>the game starts again, jump down 2 squares to the right, then
<br>back one square. Jump onto the middle square and then change
<br>the colors of the squares opposite the one on the right. Now
<br>hop up to the top square and off to the left onto the invisible
<br>pyramid.
<p>Quest for Quintana Roo
<br>"Help Yucatan Sam explore the dozens of terror-filled chambers
<br>that create the mystical temple of Mayan god Quintana Roo. You
<br>must use your supplies as well as your cat-like reactions to
<br>avoid the sleeping snakes, overcome the mummy's curse, and
<br>eliminate the other adversaries while attempting to solve the
<br>mystery that will deliver this hidden treasure to you and
<br>Yucatan Sam. Do you dare to get involved?"

<p>RealSports Baseball
<br>Designed and programmed by James Andreasen and Keithen. One
<br>of two Atari releases to feature voice synthesis (Berzerk being
<br>the other.) The 0 key toggles the voice on and off.
<p>RealSports Basketball
<br>Programmed by Patrick Bass. This game was in the early stages
<br>of development and needs some polishing. The game is playable,
<br>however, the real beauty of this proto lies in the easter eggs.
<br>As a side note, we've seen 2 versions of R.S. Basketball, one
<br>dated 13 Oct. 83 and the other 31 Oct. 83. The easter eggs
<br>listed below only work on the later version.

<p>Rescue on Fractalus
<br>Designed and programmed by David Fox, Loren Carpenter, Charlie
<br>Kellner, and Peter Langston. Contributions and support by Gary
<br>Winnick and David Levine. One of only two Atari released games
<br>that came in a white box (Ballblazer was the other) instead of
<br>the standard issue grey and blue box. This game is also one of
<br>the few Atari titles that has no name on the cartridge label.
<p>Working titles were "Behind Jaggi Lines", "Rescue Mission" and
<br>Star Mission."
<p>River Raid
<br>Designed by Carol Shaw. Scoring 40,000 points or more entitled
<br>you to a River Raiders patch if you sent a picture of your TV
<br>screen to Activision.
<p>Road Runner
<br>If you're thinking of the arcade game, forget it. This game
<br>resembles a sliding piece puzzle. We're not sure if the
<br>object of the game is to help the coyote to catch the Road
<br>Runner or to keep the two from colliding while eating all the
<br>birdseed, etc. There are 2 versions of this prototype around.
<br>One has sound (although minimal) and different colors on the
<br>opening screen while the other has no sound at all. Still
<br>some work to be done on this one.
<p>Robotron: 2084
<br>Not as good as the 7800 version, but is actually more enjoyable
<br>because of the joystick connector that allows you dual-joystick
<br>action like in the coin-op. Packaged with the joystick
<br>connector.
<p>Skiing
<br>The box for this game was shown in a flyer for the "Video
<br>System X."
<p>Soccer
<br>Designed by John Seghers. One of the many games that is
<br>trak-ball compatible. Originally just called "Soccer", Atari
<br>changed the name to fit their RealSports line-up.
<p>On par with NASL Soccer for Intellivision. Particularly
<br>enjoyable when played with the trak-ball controller.
<p>Space Dungeon
<br>The only home console port of Taito's little-known gem of a
<br>coin-op. Packaged with a joystick connector which enables dual
<br>joystick control a-la Robotron: 2084.
<p>Space Invaders
<br>One of the many games that is trak-ball compatible. The game
<br>screen on the back of the box, and in the instruction manual
<br>is not an actual screen shot. In trying to re-work this
<br>classic, Atari dropped the ball. The saucers appear one right
<br>after the other and their max value is 60 points. Your shields
<br>don't reset after each wave. After every 7th wave, the mother
<br>ship comes out and flies off with your cannon. The game then
<br>resets the shields and the invaders start back at the top of
<br>the screen. The 1986 release of this game is one of the few
<br>Atari titles that has no name on the cartridge label. It's
<br>harder to find than the standard label version.
<p>Space Shuttle
<br>Designed by Steve Kitchen. 5200 adaptation by Bob Henderson.
<br>Steve Kitchen apparently consulted with NASA to make this game
<br>as accurate as possible. Like many other Activision titles,
<br>this game was later released in a 2600 box w/ photocopied
<br>instructions. Dock your shuttle 5 times and land with at
<br>least 4500 units of fuel and you were entitled to a Space
<br>Shuttle Pilot patch. Dock 6 times and land with at least
<br>7500 units of fuel and you earned a Space Shuttle Commander
<br>patch. Just send the usual TV picture proof to Activision.
<p>Spitfire
<br>This seems to be a Zaxxon style game, but with full 360 degree
<br>movement and Crystal Castles style structures. Obviously in
<br>the very early stages of development.
<p>Sport Goofy
<br>In it's current form, this game consists of two separate
<br>"events". One is a platform Sky Diver type game where you
<br>guide Goofy to the top of a structure and then when he jumps
<br>off, you guide him into a waiting raft below. The other game
<br>is a Q*bert type game where you try to pop the overhead
<br>balloons as you hop between squares.
<p>Stargate
<br>Programmed by Steve Baker. The sequel to Defender suffers
<br>from screen flicker and poor control. Let's hope it was still
<br>in the early stages as we would hate to think this was almost
<br>ready for release.
<p>Star Raiders
<br>Originally a smash hit on the Atari 400/800 computers, Star
<br>Raiders is enshrined in the Electronic Games Magazine Videogame
<br>Hall of Fame.
<p>Super Breakout
<br>One of the few games that supports 4 players on the older
<br>4-port models. Also one of the many games that is trak-ball
<br>compatible. This game was initially packaged with the Atari
<br>5200 console, but was later replaced by Pac-Man.
<p>Superman III
<br>A box for this game exists, but an actual prototype game of
<br>Superman III has not yet been recovered. A prototype version
<br>for the Atari home computers does exist, however.
<p>Super Pac-Man
<br>Recently discovered! Was demonstrated for the first time at
<br>World of Atari '98 in Las Vegas. An absolutely fantastic

<p>Tempest
<br>It's been found! Demonstrated for the first time at World of

<p>Ticker Tape Demo
<br>Recently discovered and shown for the first time at World of
<br>Atari '98 in Las Vegas. Basically just a generic 5200 title
<br>screen, except that after seeing Rubio's copyright info, the
<br>phrase "Again Rubio Scores!" replaces the top line and begins
<br>to scroll and move side-to-side, banging on the left and right
<br>edges. Each time the phrase hits the outer edge of the screen,
<br>one of the letters on the outside disappears. This continues
<br>to occur until the word "Rubio" is left. This custom scrolling
<br>demo was done internally for Dan Kramer and DK Enterprises.
<br>Only one is know to exist. For more info on this demo, check
<br>out Atari Gaming Headquarters

<p>Toy Bizarre
<br>Made it to the C64, but not 5200.
<p>Track 'N Field
<br>Licensed from Konami. This one was probably ready for
<br>production. Seems very complete with no noticeable bugs or
<br>glitches.
<p>Tumbleweeds
<br>Designed for Atari's unreleased "Puffer" exercise bicycle, a
<br>prototype version of this game has recently been discovered.
<p>Vanguard
<br>This game would have been perfect for 2 joystick control a-la
<br>Space Dungeon and Robotron. The 1986 release of this game is
<br>one of the few Atari titles that has no name on the cartridge
<br>label. It's harder to find than the standard label version.
<p>Warp Wars
<br>Warp Wars was the working title for the game Zone Ranger.
<p>Wizard of Wor
<br>Programmed by Roklan Corp.
<p>Xari Arena
<br>Programmed by David Seghers. This game seems to be an updated
<br>Breakout type of game. What are those flying things in the
<br>middle of the screen? Havent figured out how to play it yet
<br>but it looks good.
<p>Xevious
<br>Programmed by Jim Huether. This very nice conversion of the
<br>coin-op utilizes both fire buttons. No noticeable bugs or
<br>glitches.
<p>Yellow Submarine Demo
<br>Not really a game, but rather a graphics demo where you
<br>control a submarine on the screen with your joystick. Only a
<br>precious few are known to exist.
<p>Zone Ranger
<br>Warp Wars was its working title.
<p>2.6 -- WHAT'S THE REAL STORY BEHIND CLOAK AND DAGGER?
<br>-----------------------------------------------------
<p>Many die-hard collectors and 5200 fans are aware that a Cloak and
<br>Dagger (and, for that matter, Tempest) cartridge was shown in the
<br>move of the same name as sort of a tantalizing preview of the game.
<br>What nobody knew, however, was whether Cloak and Dagger existed as
<br>a prototype, or if the game code even existed in any form.
<p>Alex Rosenberg gave us the definitive answer in 1994 when he posted
<br>to rec.games.video.classic. Here are some snippets from his
<br>newsgroup article.
<p>-------
<p>From: alexr@apple.com (Alex Rosenberg)
<br>Re: 5200 Cloak and Dagger cartridge
<br>Date: Mon Sep 12 1994
<p>I can give the definitive answer here. I used to work with the author
<br>of the 5200 version of Cloak and Dagger. I've previously asked him
<br>about it, and he had sent me the
<br>following message:
<p>--- CUT HERE ---
<p>Yes, I can answer your question about the Atari 5200 version of Cloak
<br>&amp; Dagger.
<p>When Warner Communications sold the consumer side of Atari to Jack
<br>Tramiel (who founded Commodore) in mid-1984, I was working on the
<br>Atari 400/800/1200 version of Cloak &amp; Dagger. Since the Atari 5200
<br>was basically just an Atari 400 with a different controller, when I
<br>completed the home computer version, I was supposed to modify the
<br>game to use the "360-degree" 5200 controller (as opposed to the
<br>9-position home computer joystick).
<p>By the way here's a little known fact about Cloak &amp; Dagger: someone
<br>at Atari actually explored doing an Atari 2600 version of Cloak &amp;
<br>Dagger, but very quickly decided that it couldn't be done, even with
<br>major simplifications...
<p>If you've ever seen the Cloak &amp; Dagger movie, you'll know that the
<br>cartridge shown in the movie was a 5200 cartridge. Actually, the 5200
<br>cartridge didn't even exist: it was a 5200 cartridge of another game
<br>with a "Cloak &amp; Dagger" label slapped on it. Also, in the game
store
<br>scenes, there were Atari 5200 Cloak &amp; Dagger boxes shown. Those
were
<br>also just mockups made for the movie.
<p>But wait a second! Wasn't the Atari 5200 Cloak &amp; Dagger game actually
<br>PLAYED in the movie (and didn't it look damn good)? Hollywood movie
<br>magic! They took the output of the coin-operated game, converted the
<br>signal, and piped it to a TV set. So if you thought it looked a lot
<br>like the coin-op game, you were right. Another interesting fact:
<br>Henry Thomas wasn't really playing the game; instead, Atari sent down
<br>the game's software developer, Rusty Dawe, to play the coin-op game
<br>for the movie! So they showed Henry Thomas furiously working the 5200
<br>controller, cut to the television showing Rusty's progress in the
<br>game (sometimes even with Henry's reflection in the screen), and back
<br>again. Rusty -- er, make that Russell B. Dawe -- got his own full-
<br>screen credit at the end of the movie for the game design.
<p>Although the rest of the game shown in the movie was taken from the
<br>real coin-op game, the spectacular 3D "secret plans" finale of the
<br>game was pure Holywood animation: the real game ends somewhat anti-
<br>climactically with one of several static, crudely-drawn blueprints.
I
<br>don't recall whether Rusty ran short of ROM space or time, but the
<br>secret plans weren't up to the quality of the rest of the game, much
<br>less the movie game's ending.
<p>Oh, and another piece of trivia: the original name of the Cloak &amp;
<br>Dagger coin-operated game was actually...Agent X (hence the name of
<br>the protagonist in the game and the off-hand comment by Dabney
<br>Coleman in the movie that he "used to be known as Agent X"). The game
<br>had been under development at Atari as "Agent X" for quite a while,
<br>and was nearly completed. The movie studio (can't remember which one
<br>off-hand, but I have the Laserdisc) had the movie under development
<br>as Cloak &amp; Dagger. The game cartridge that was in the original
<br>screenplay was...Donkey Kong (at the time, the most popular home
<br>videogame)! Someone at either the movie studio or Atari found out
<br>about the other, "the secret agent recovers secret plans from bad
<br>guys" plots sounded like they were made for each other, the deal was
<br>signed, and the Agent X game was renamed Cloak &amp; Dagger.
<p>Anyway, back to the layoff. My half of Atari (the half that just
<br>released the Jaguar videogame system; it's still known as "Atari,
<br>Inc.") got sold, and they laid off almost all the game developers who
<br>didn't have experience writing operating systems, myself included.
<br>When the layoffs happened, I was close to halfway done with the game.
<br>The basic structure of all the levels was done (conveyor belts,
<br>boxes, bubbling acid pits, box manufacturers, minefields) and you
<br>could move Agent X around, pick up boxes, and die from touching red
<br>boxes, being crushed by the box manufacturing thingies (what the hell
<br>were they called?), stepping in an acid pit, or touching a landmine
<br>(although the death animation wasn't in yet, so you just turned pitch
<br>black).
<p>But none of the enemies were done, you couldn't shoot yet (although,
<br>without enemies, you would only be able to shoot the boxes anyway),
<br>and the bomb in the center didn't explode (the animation of the bomb
<br>exploding in the coin-op game is fast, but it's actually pretty
<br>crude). No elevator scenes yet, either, although since the cartridge
<br>was supposed to be the first Atari home computer cartridge to reach
a
<br>whopping 32K (all previous cartridges had been 16K or less!), there
<br>was enough room for many -- if not all -- of the elevator animations.
<br>(If you look closely, you'll notice that very little of Agent X
<br>actually moves in the elevator scenes: an arm, a facial expression,
<br>smoke, an arm and a yo-yo, etc.)
<p>In 1983, at one of Atari's periodic auctions of prototype and no
<br>longer needed coin-operated machines (including games like DigDug and
<br>Berzerk whose translations to Atari home computers and/or videogame
<br>systems had already been completed), I bought one of the original 25
<br>(I believe) Agent X machines. These prototypes, which had been sent
<br>to arcades for test-marketing, had stereo sound (Atari went with mono
<br>sound for the final hardware) and the pre-Cloak &amp; Dagger faceplates.
<br>The ROMs were upgraded to reflect the name change, however, so, on
<br>the inside, my machine is a real Cloak &amp; Dagger!
<p>Anyway, hope you enjoyed the history and stories. I'd always wanted
<br>to finish the home computer version of Cloak &amp; Dagger, but over
the
<br>years, my free time has almost completed vanished. The Atari 5200
<br>version of Cloak &amp; Dagger, as well as versions of many other classic
<br>Atari games -- Crystal Castles (which was nearly finished when the
<br>layoff happened), Major Havoc (one of my favorite coin-op games, but
<br>the home computer conversion was barely started at the time of the
<br>layoffs), and Jr. Pac-Man (completed, but not released), to name just
<br>a few -- were all casualties of the sale of Atari's consumer business
<br>to Tramiel and the resulting layoffs. Everyone who was left
<br>immediately switched from developing games (new as well as
<br>conversions of coin-operated games) to working on the operating
<br>system for the Atari 520ST and 1040ST.
<p>Sorry to dash your hopes about the Atari 5200 Cloak &amp; Dagger...

<p>2.8 -- WHAT IS THE 5200 MULTICART AND HOW CAN I GET ONE?
<br>--------------------------------------------------------
<p>The Atari 5200 multi-cart is a single cartridge with virtually
<br>the entire Atari 5200 game library on it -- even prototypes. It
<br>comes packaged in a regular 5200 cartridge casing. Very basically,
<br>it can be looked at as a comparatively inexpensive way to be able to
<br>play all the 5200 games in one handy cart. Titles such as
<br>Meteorites, Star Wars: Death Star Battle, and others are going to
<br>cost you and arm and a leg if you are able to locate someone with a
<br>copy of them, but they are all included on the multi-cart, in their
<br>entirely mind you, for one flat-fee.
<p>As far as collectibility goes, the multi-cart is still being made and
<br>will continue to be for the foreseeable future so it's worth exactly
<br>what you pay for it - no more.
<p>If you are interested in purchasing one or would like additional
<br>information about it, you can e-mail Sean Kelly at skelly@xnet.com
or
<br>pay a visit to his web page at http://www.xnet.com/~skelly/ where he
<br>has information about the multi-cart and all other multi-carts he
<br>makes.

<p>3.3 -- GENERAL HARDWARE TIDBITS
<br>-------------------------------
<p>5200 Hotel Unit
<br>A console made by Spectravision (not to be mistaken for the
<br>third party publisher of 2600 games, that's a different
<br>Spectravision) that was used in hotels and motels. This unit
<br>had a selection switch for television, movies and games. Game
<br>boards were able to be added by placing them into a 4-game
<br>internal cartridge board rack.
<p>Asteroids Controller
<br>Recently discovered, this device was planned to compliment
<br>5200 Asteroids. The control layout is identical to the
<br>coin-op. Only one of these items is known to exist.
<p>Atari 5100
<br>A prototype system that is completely compatible with the
<br>(4-port) 5200. It was a trimmed down version of the 5200, much
<br>like how the 2600jr. was a low-cost redesign of the woodgrain
<br>VCS/2600.
<p>Atari 5200 Carrying Case
<br>Made of durable hard plastic and shaped like a suitcase, it can
<br>store the console, power supply and two joysticks. Similar to
<br>the cases found in Blockbuster video for systems that it rents
<br>out to its customers.
<p>Atari 7800 Cartridge Adapter
<br>Announced but never released. This adapter would have allowed
<br>5200 owners to play 7800 games without buying the 7800 system
<br>separately (although the savings would probably have been
<br>negligible).
<p>Atari 5200 Joystick Coupler
<br>Allowed dual-joystick action for Robotron: 2084 and Space
<br>Dungeon by snapping two 5200 joysticks into place using this
<br>connector. Packaged with both Robotron: 2084 and Space Dungeon,
<br>and was not sold separately.
<p>Atari Video System X
<br>The working title of the 5200 before Atari opted for a
<br>numerical designation for its "third wave" videogame system.
<br>Actual photos of the VS-X, which looked almost exactly like the
<br>5200 with the exception of a few cosmetic differences such as on
<br>the face plate, were shown throughout contemporary magazines
<br>for much of 1982.
<p>Competition Pro Joystick
<br>An excellent third-party controller, the Competition Pro is
<br>micro-switch based, giving a satisfying "click, click" response
<br>to movements in the joystick. (Arguably) Better than the Wico
<br>Command Control Joystick, but harder to find.
<p>Control Guide
<br>Here's a novel approach. Since games like Pac-Man require
<br>pin-point precision control (something the 5200 sticks are
<br>incapable of), Newport Controls decided to limit the movement
<br>of the stick. They designed a piece of plastic that goes over
<br>the top of a standard controller. It has grooves that only
<br>allows the stick to go up, down, left, and right. A steal for
<br>the $6.95 they originally sold for; so how come there aren't
<br>more of these floating around?
<p>Fire Command Joystick
<br>Offering a slightly different feel than its non-analog cousin
<br>for the 2600, the 5200-compatible version featured two buttons
<br>and a y-adapter that must be connected to the keypad for full
<br>compatibility (like the Wico and Competition Pro).
<p>Frob, The
<br>Allowed its owners to program 5200 games using an Apple
<br>II/II+/IIe computer.
<p>Kid's Controller
<br>Similar to the 2600 Kid's Controller, only one prototype of
<br>this peripheral is known to exist. Astro Grover and Big Bird's
<br>Hide &amp; Seek are but two of the titles believed to support this
<br>device.
<p>Masterplay Interface
<br>Without a doubt, this is the ultimate solution to your
<br>5200 joystick woes. Quite simply, this handy little box allows
<br>you to use 2600 compatible joysticks on the 5200 and has a port
<br>to plug in a standard Atari joystick for keypad functions, etc.
<br>For games that required the top fire button on a standard
<br>stick, the Masterplay comes packaged with an auxiliary fire
<br>button that does the job very well. There are two different
<br>boxes available for the Interface; one is similar to a cartridge
<br>box and the other is a smaller yet wider box. Both the
<br>Masterplay Interface and Meteorites are sometimes listed as
<br>being made by a company called Intellicon. In actuality,
<br>Intellicon was nothing more than a mail-order company that
<br>bought and sold off the remaining inventory from Electra Concepts.
<p>Paddle Controller
<br>Recently discovered, this device is identical in appearance to
<br>the standard 5200 joystick controller, except that a paddle is
<br>found on the top of the controller where the joystick is
<br>normally located.
<p>POP Demo Kiosk
<br>POP stands for Point Of Purchase. These demo units allowed
<br>gamers to sample several 5200 carts. Much like the demo kiosks
<br>for newer systems.
<p>Puffer, The
<br>A home exercise bicycle with two hand grip controllers, a wheel
<br>speed pickup, and the necessary interfacing for an Atari
<br>computer or 5200. For detailed information, see the Puffer
<br>section elsewhere in this FAQ.
<p>Trak-Ball Controller (Transparent)
<br>Recently discovered, the clear Trak-Ball was used for
<br>promotional purposes only and was never planned for release.
<p>Triga Elite Joystick
<br>Only a very few of these were made. It is not known whether
<br>they made it past the prototype stage and onto store shelves.
<br>This joystick had two fire buttons, an adjustable rapid-fire
<br>button, and a digital - analog switch. A picture can be seen on
<br>the back of the Masterplay Interface box (2nd stick from the
<br>left).
<p>Voice Commander Module
<br>Milton Bradley and Atari were jointly associated with this
<br>speech synthesis/recognition device, where Milton Bradley was to
<br>develop the add-on while Atari was responsible for developing
<br>games for it. However, Atari canned the idea shortly
<br>thereafter. A module for the 2600 was also planned, but it too
<br>was axed before development went too far. Milton Bradley later
<br>sued Atari for breach of contract.
<p>Wico Command Control Joystick
<br>An analog (but self-centering) controller that featured two
<br>fire buttons and the ability to calibrate the joysticks. Came
<br>packaged with a y-adapter cord which enabled the use of keypad
<br>functions of the standard 5200 controller.
<p>Wico Command Control Numeric Keypad
<br>A stand-alone keypad which substituted for the 5200 joystick
<br>keypad when used in conjunction with the Wico joystick.
<br>Although this item had a 9-pin connector, it was only compatible
<br>with the Wico controller. Sold separately from the joystick.
<p>3.4 -- WHAT WAS THE TOP-SECRET "PUFFER PROJECT"?
<br>------------------------------------------------
<p>Sensing an opportunity to bring health fitness and videogames
<br>together, in 1982 Atari embarked on "Project Puffer," a top-secret
<br>mission to develop a home exercise bike with two hand grip
<br>controllers, a wheel speed pickup, and the necessary attachments
<br>for an Atari computer or 5200. By interfacing their machines to an
<br>exercise bicycle, Atari planned to make exercising fun.
<p>The Puffer featured hand controllers which easily attached to most
<br>existing exercise cycles and gave the conscientious user directional
<br>control. The act of peddling was to give the imaginary vehicle
<br>motion and the rider exercise. Therefore, no peddling--no motion.
<br>For the overzealous cyclist, a pulse rate sensor could be added to
<br>monitor excessive heart beat activity.
<p>The two hand controllers replaced the original hand grips on the
<br>exercycle. The Puffer controllers were designed to fit as many of
<br>the current exercycles as possible while at the same time remaining
<br>inexpensive and durable. A magnet attached to the wheel monitored
<br>the wheel speed and a Hall effect sensor detected the passing magnet
<br>which can be read by the computer to calculate the wheel speed. The
<br>housing for the sensor was also the junction box for the hand
<br>controller cables and the computer cable. The computer required only
<br>one cable to be connected to a joystick input.
<p>Three new programs were developed to show Puffer's capabilities in
<br>particular applications, and one more was modified to show its
<br>limitations. The games were Jungle River Cruise (originally called
<br>"Riverboat"), Tumbleweeds, Pole Position, and Ms. Pac-Man, all for
<br>the 5200 and 400/800 (a 2600 game appears to have never been
<br>developed).
<p>In order to reach a wide spectrum of consumers, Atari planned on
<br>producing three Puffer models - the Pro Model, an Arcade Model and
a
<br>Home Model (for the 2600, 5200 and 8-bit computers)
<p>The Home Model consisted of two types -- a folding exercise bike
<br>sourced on an OEM basis with Atari controls mounted on them, or an
<br>add-on module for those who already own an exercise bike. The Home
<br>Puffer was to plug into the joystick port of a 5200, 400/800 or VCS.
<p>The suggested retail price was to be $150 with one game packaged with
<br>the Puffer. Atari had plans on releasing controllers to fit other
<br>exercise instruments such as rowing machines and foot pads if the
<br>Puffer proved to be a success.
<p>Just as Atari was ready for production of the Puffer and its
<br>compatible software programs, the project was put in the back burner
<br>as Atari began to lose an incredible amount of money in the
<br>marketplace. The Puffer was resurrected in early 1984, and Atari
<br>planned to aggressively market and sell the Puffer in the summer of
<br>1984, with a full-scale marketing campaign that was to coincide with
<br>the Los Angeles 1984 Olympics.
<p>However, the purchase of Atari by Sam Tramiel in the Spring of 1984
<br>brought an end to the ambitious product, as the new regime under
<br>the Tramiels sought to identify Atari as a professional home computer
<br>company.

<br>5200. Have trust in the console's voltage regulators to take
<br>care of things.
<p>4.2 -- HARDWARE OVERVIEW
<br>------------------------
<p>The Atari 5200 is essentially a console version of the Atari 8-bit
<br>Computers (400/800, XL, XE, XEGS). The functions of the system are
<br>divided up between four major IC chips:
<p>CPU:
<p>The CPU in the 5200 is a modified 6502 processor. The only
<br>difference is that Atari's version of this CPU has some extra
<br>hardware on board that allows the ANTIC chip to take over the bus to
<br>do Direct Memory Access (DMA).
<p>POKEY:
<p>POKEY's main job is to generate sound and to perform a variety of
<br>other miscellaneous functions. The POKEY chip has four separate
<br>channels, and the pitch, volume and distortion values of each of
<br>these channels can be controlled individually. POKEY is also used to
<br>read the position of each of the joysticks, and scans the keypad on
<br>each controller for key presses. Its other functions include the
<br>random number generator, IRQ handling, and 3 high-speed counters.
<br>POKEY also has a serial communications port that is connected to the
<br>5200's expansion port.
<p>ANTIC:
<p>ANTIC can be thought of as the 5200's graphics co-processor. ANTIC
<br>has direct access to RAM where it reads a special program called the
<br>display list. The display list tells ANTIC exactly how to draw the
<br>display and then sends information to the GTIA which generates the
<br>actual video signals. The 5200 supports 17 seperate video modes;
<br>some are character modes, others graphic. Each mode has a different
<br>combination of vertical size, horizontal size, and number of colors.
<br>Using the display list, these modes can be mixed freely on a single
<br>screen, so for example a screen could have a couple lines of text
<br>mode at the top, a block of hi-res graphics in the middle, and more
<br>text at the bottom. The location in memory that the display date
<br>comes from can easily be controlled through ANTIC. The display data
<br>can be almost anywhere in memory, and it is even possible for the
<br>data for each line to come from totally different places in memory.
<br>This allows horizontal and vertical scrolling to be implemented very
<br>easily. ANTIC is also responsible for controlling Non-Maskable
<br>Interrupt to the processor.
<p>GTIA:
<p>The GTIA's main responsibility is to generate the video signals to
<br>the TV and to handle sprites. The GTIA is where the actual colors
<br>are put into the video signal. The 5200 has a palette of 256 colors.
<br>Most video modes only allow four colors, but a facility in the ANTIC
<br>chip allows the values of these colors to be changed on each line of
<br>the screen, so it is possible to have all 256 colors on screen at
<br>once. The 5200 has four player and four missile sprites. Player
<br>sprite are eight pixels wide and either 128 or 256 pixels high,
<br>missiles are two pixels wide and either 128 or 256 pixels high. Each
<br>sprite can have its on color, independent from the normal screen
<br>colors. The GTIA chip can detect collisions between players,
<br>missiles, and the playfield. This chip is also responsible for
<br>reading joystick trigger buttons, and controlling which controller
<br>is being read by POKEY.

<p>4.8 -- WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 2-PORT AND
<br>4-PORT MODELS?
<br>------------------------------------------------------
<p>The 4-joystick-port model comes with an automated RF switch box that
<br>is not found in the 2-port machine. The 4-port unit has a unique
<br>power setup. The power supply plugs into the TV switchbox and the
<br>TV wire from the 5200 carries power to the system from the switchbox
<br>while also providing the video display to the TV. In addition, most
<br>4-port 5200 systems cannot use the VCS cartridge adapter without
<br>modifications. Several other minor differences also exist between
<br>the two machines.
<p>--
<br>(Taken from ANALOG Magazine)
<p>Later releases of the 5200 incorporate some minor hardware changes.
<br>Controller ports 3 and 4 have been eliminated, making POT7, TRIG2,
<br>TRIG3, and bit 1 of CONSOL useless. A few of the connector pins
<br>have been redefined. Pin 2 of the I/O expansion connector now
<br>carries POKEY's Audio Out signal. Three pins on the cartridge
<br>connector have changed to accommodate the new 2600 adapter. The
<br>system clock, 02, is output on pin 14, isolated through a diode. An
<br>alternate video input is taken from pin 24 and is also isolated
<br>through a diode. Pin 30 provides an alternate audio input.
<p>There is space on the newer boards for circuitry for a PAL (European
<br>TV standard) version of the 5200. Also, on power-up, the monitor
<br>program checks for the PAL version by examining the GTIA register PAL
<br>after step 2 of the initialization routine. It also checks the
<br>cartridge program for PAL compatibility. The byte at $BFE7 should
<br>read $02 if compatible, or $00 if not. This is the only important
<br>change to the monitor program. There are some additional hardware
<br>changes, but none affects the machine's operation from the
<br>programmer's view.
<p>4.9 -- HOW CAN THE 4-PORT MODEL BE MODIFIED TO WORK WITH THE VCS
<br>CARTRIDGE ADAPTER?
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Early 5200s that have four joystick ports cannot accept the VCS
<br>(2600) adapter unless modifications are made. However, Best
<br>Electronics offers an adapter kit which allows the use of the VCS
<br>adapter on 4-port models.
<p>*** NOTE -- Owners of 4-port 5200 machines with an "*" as part of
<br>the serial number are in luck. Atari apparently made a small run of
<br>VCS-compatible 4-port units before changing over to the 2-port units.
<p>4.10 - 2-PORT PRODUCTION MODIFICATIONS
<br>--------------------------------------
<p>There are three production modifications to the logic board of 2-port
<br>5200 systems. A number of people have seen these mods on their 5200s
<br>and the mods appear to have been factory installed.
<p>1. Pin 11 of A5 (GTIA) is lifted out of the socket. This pin on the
<br>GTIA is the trigger 3 input which is unused on the 2-port model.
<br>When it is in the socket, it is connected to trigger 1. This mod
<br>probably had something to do with the change from 4-ports to 2.
<p>2. Pins 8,9,10 and 11 of A7 (POKEY) are connected to pin 1 of A7 on
<br>the back of the board. This mod connects the paddle 4,5,6 and 7
<br>inputs to ground. This mod also had something to do with the
<br>change from 4-ports to 2.
<p>3. A wire is run from the feed thru below C94 to A27 pin 1, pin 1
<br>and 2 of A27 are connected together on the back of the board, pin
<br>10 of A15 is lifted, and connected to A27 pin 3. This
<br>modification alters the timing of CAS to the dynamic RAM.

<br>4-port model)
<p>A1 4050
<br>Video signal buffer
<p>A2 C014806 CPU 6502C
<br>This is a custom version of the standard 6502 microprocessor. It is
<br>functionally identical to a standard 6502, except that hardware has
<br>been added to it that allows the ANTIC chip to do Direct Memory
<br>Access (DMA).
<p>A3 C012296 ANTIC
<br>This chip is a microprocessor that reads data directly from RAM to
<br>determine how the screen should be drawn and controls the GTIA to
<br>actually generate the graphics. The ANTIC is also responsible for
<br>processing NMI's.
<p>A5 C014805 GTIA
<br>This chip is responsible for generating the video signal to the TV,
<br>generating sprites, reading the joystick trigger buttons, and
<br>controlling the reading of the joysticks and keypads (the actual
<br>reading is done by POKEY).
<p>A6 74LS139
<br>Address decoding.
<p>A7 C012294 POKEY
<br>This chip is responsible for generating sound, reading the position
<br>of the joystick, reading the keypad buttons, processing IRQ's and,
<br>controlling the serial I/O port which is accessible through the
<br>expansion connector.
<p>A8 C019156A ROM BIOS

<p>4.12 - DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 5200 AND ATARI 8-BIT COMPUTERS
<br>-------------------------------------------------------------
<p>The 5200 is basically an Atari Computer without a keyboard. It has
<br>all the major chips that the computers have with the exception of the
<br>PIA chip, but most of the chips are at different memory locations.
<p>The differences between the two machines are as follows:
<p>* Memory
<br>The 5200 has a fixed 16K of RAM. Memory locations $00-$18 and
<br>$200-$21B are reserved for the BIOS to use.
<p>* ROM
<br>The BIOS ROM of the 5200 is only 2K instead of 10K. Virtually
<br>none of the computer's BIOS functions are implemented on the 5200.
<p>* ANTIC
<br>The 5200 does not have a System Reset key, so bit 5 of NMIST is
<br>not used.
<p>* GTIA
<br>The trigger inputs, TRIG0-TRIG3 are connected to the bottom
<br>buttons of the controllers. The 5200 does not have Start, Select,
<br>or Option buttons, so these lines are used as outputs. Bit 2 of
<br>CONSOL enables and disables the joystick pots. Bits 0 and 1
<br>control which keypad controller is being read. This only affects
<br>the keypad buttons, and the top trigger buttons.
<p>* POKEY
<br>The eight paddle inputs from the computer are now wired to the
<br>joysticks, 2 to each stick, one for vertical position and the
<br>other for horizontal position. The joysticks are read in the same
<br>way that the computer's paddles are read. On the 5200 the KBCODE
<br>register bits 1-4 hold the scan code from the currently selected
<br>keypad controller. Bit 6 of KBCODE is used to read the top button
<br>of the controllers instead of the SHIFT key. They also cause the
<br>BREAK-key interrupt. The POKEY's serial lines are connected to
<br>the expansion connector.
<p>* Cartridge
<br>The cartridges can be up to 32K. There are two interlock
<br>connectors that are wired together on a cartridge board. The 5200
<br>uses this as a switch for the cartridge's power connections and as
<br>a Reset signal. Therefore, a cartridge may be safely removed or
<br>inserted while the 5200 is powered on.
<p>4.13 - CHROMA/LUMA (COMPOSITE VIDEO) AND AUDIO OUTPUT MODIFICATION
<br>------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Differences between 2-port and 4-port consoles:
<br>Not surprisingly, there are very few appreciable differences
<br>between the 2-port and 4-port variations of the 5200. For the
<br>purposes of this article, they are considered to be identical.
<p>Where to get signals:
<br>Most of the components do not have visible labels on the board's
<br>silkscreen, so giving component numbers is not useful. In the
<br>upper right corner of the area of the board that's covered by the
<br>shielding, there is a horizontal row of components.

<p>Luma output:
<p>The Luma signal needs amplification to be useful. After probing
<br>around on an Atari 800 (a close relative to the 5200 that
<br>conveniently has Croma/Luma outputs built-in), I realized the
<br>amplifier circuit they used is remarkably similar to the one
<br>attributed to Thomas Clancy in the Classic Atari Game Systems FAQ.
<br>Rather than try to copy the circuit on the Atari 800 or design one
<br>from scratch, I decided to use the one given there. The only
<br>significant difference is the addition of another level of
<br>luminance.

<p>Chroma output:
<p>In my experience, the 5200's chroma signal is sufficiently strong
<br>that it can be used without amplification. On my own 5200, I
<br>ran the chroma through a 2kohm resistor to "take the edge off,"
<br>then a 1uF capacitor to filter the DC voltage off. Play around
<br>with the resistance there to find what suits you.

<p>Composite video output:
<br>To gain composite output, just tie the Luma and Chroma outputs
<br>together into a single output.
<p>Where to put it:
<br>I mounted the circuits on a small project board from Radio Shack,
<br>tapping into the appropriate points on the 5200 board with a
<br>length of ribbon cable. I then tucked the board into the
<br>controller storage space at the back of the console and ran the
<br>output signals to three RCA jacks I had mounted in the removable
<br>expansion interface cover. That way the only permanently
<br>modified/damaged piece (the cover) is also one that is easily
<br>replaced.
<p>4.14 -- HOW DO I BUILD A SWITCHBOX FOR THE 4-PORT 5200?
<br>-------------------------------------------------------
<p>The early Atari 5200's came with an unusual switchbox which supplied
<br>power to the 5200 down the same wire the 5200 uses to send the video
<br>signal to your TV. The power supply plugged into the switchbox.
<br>Unfortunately, these switchboxes seem to have gotten lost over the
<br>years and are difficult to come by. Newer 5200's (the one with only
<br>two controller ports) had the power supply jack on the console
<br>itself. Fortunately, it is not difficult to construct your own
<br>RF/power supply box for the 5200. There is one difference, though.
<br>The original 5200 switchbox would automatically switch from your TV
<br>antenna/cable to the 5200 when you turned the console on. With the
<br>RF/power box described below, you will need to use a standard
<br>game/TV switchbox.
<p>The following parts are needed to construct the box. Where
<br>applicable, Radio Shack part numbers, and prices, have been
<br>provided (these may be outdated). You may use another RCA jack in
<br>place of the F jack if you wish. I chose to use the F jack to avoid
<br>ever accidentally plugging the 5200 and TV cables in backwards,
<br>which would result in 11.5 volts DC going into your TV set,
<br>possibly damaging it.

<br>choke to the center pins of
<br>the DC power jack and the RCA
<br>jack. Screw the box shut.
<br>You're done.
<p>The switchbox works as follows. The capacitor transparently passes
<br>the video signal from the 5200 to the TV output jack, while at the
<br>same time preventing the DC power from the power supply jack from
<br>going into your TV. The choke (inductor) transparently passes the
<br>11.5 volt DC power to the 5200 via the RCA jack while at the same
<br>time preventing the video signal from escaping back down the power
<br>supply wire. The bolt around which the choke is wound helps to
<br>increase the choke's inductance to block more of the video signal
<br>from going back into the power supply than it otherwise would. The
<br>aluminum box itself helps keep the video signal confined to where
<br>it belongs to prevent possible interference and to ensure that as
<br>much of the signal as possible gets to your TV. For this reason,
<br>plastic boxes are not recommended.
<p>Finally, another note about the 5200 power supply. The 5200 power
<br>supply is 11.5 volts DC @ 1.95 amps and has a standard type coaxial
<br>plug (center positive 5mm OD, 2.1mm ID). Or you could construct one
<br>from a transformer, 4 diodes, two capacitors, a resistor, a 3A adj.
<br>voltage regulator, heat sink, case, and cabling, or find a 12V 2A
<br>power supply and add a diode inline to drop the voltage by 0.5V.

<br>5.0) MAINTENANCE, REPLACEMENT AND REPAIR TIPS
<br>===============================================
<p>5.1 -- CONSOLE
<br>--------------
<p>Coming Soon.
<p>5.2 -- CONTROLLERS
<br>------------------
<p>5.21 - CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE
<br>-------------------------------
<p>Atari 5200 controller buttons, mainly the fire and start/pause/reset
<br>buttons, wear out prematurely, either by repeated use or by periods
<br>of non-use. Here's the easy way to fix the 5200 controller buttons.
<br>The buttons work by pressing a carbon coated disc against a set of
<br>circuits. The two circuits are interweaved and a connection is made
<br>when the carbon touches both traces. The traces look like this:
<p>|----- |
<br>| ------|
<br>|------ |
<br>| ------|
<p>The carbon coated discs are located on the underside of the rubber
<br>you press. What makes them quit working is the exposed circuit
<br>traces which corrode and get dirty, not allowing the connection to
be
<br>made. This is especially true if the controllers are stored for some
<br>time in a damp place (or just unused for a long amount of time) (or
<br>especially if you spill pop on them :). The quick way to fix them is
<br>to clean the traces. This can be done by rubbing (gently!) with a
<br>pencil eraser until shiny clean. This will remedy the situation, but
<br>they will soon corrode again, depending on use. (some versions of the
<br>controllers used different coatings on the traces to avoid this, but
<br>these only slightly prolong the life of the buttons; I haven't seen
<br>any that don't need some periodic cleaning). To open the controller
<br>to clean, follow these steps EXACTLY:
<p>1) With a small screwdriver, pry up the bezel surrounding the start/
<br>pause/reset buttons. Remove the rubber buttons if they don't
<br>come out with the bezel. Now peel the printed circuit off the
<br>plastic case; it's just glued onto it. Lift the right side, as
<br>the left side has connections into the controller. Do NOT rip or
<br>remove the circuit, just unglue it from the case.
<p>2) Remove the three screws from the bottom of the case. Center the
<br>joystick, and leave it there. Now seperate the case halves by
<br>first starting at the start/pause/reset end. The other end is
<br>pressed together; it will snap apart if you seperate the cases.
<br>Don't move the potentiometers in the bottom of the case for the
<br>stick won't mate back up when you put it back together.
<p>3) Remove the fire buttons and their bezels. Now the traces for the
<br>fire buttons are exposed. Clean them by rubbing with an eraser.
<br>Wipe off with a clean napkin or something similar afterwards.
<p>4) Place the fire buttons and their bezels into the lower half of
<br>the case. Guide the start/pause/reset circuit up through the
<br>upper case half where it belongs, and bring the two halves
<br>together. By centering the stick before placing the halves
<br>together, its receptacle will automatically fit into the bottom
<br>of the case, and the two directional axis plates will
<br>automatically hook up with the potentiometers. It's best to
<br>place the numerical keypad end together loosely first, as this
<br>will allow peering into the joystick end as it goes together to
<br>make sure everything lines up. The end of the joystick has to go
<br>into the hole in the bottom case, and the posts on the two arms
<br>on the potentiometers have to go into their respective holes on
<br>the plates in the upper case. After aligning everything
<br>together, make sure the stick moves in all directions freely and
<br>completely. If so, you can screw back in the three screws.
<p>5) Re-stick the start/pause/reset circuit to the case, then clean
<br>these traces as described above. Replace the buttons and the
<br>bezel.
<p>You can also clean the keypad traces while it's apart, they don't
<br>seem to get used as much, so will usually work a lot longer. The
<br>flex circuits with the traces on them are fragile, so be gentle
<br>around them. A hairline crack in a trace can cause certain buttons
<br>not to work at all. These cracks can be repaired by soldering a
<br>bridge over the crack. Careful, the flex circuit often melts before
<br>the solder does!
<p>The permanent way to fix these buttons is by soldering sealed,
<br>surface-mount micro-button switches onto the circuits. This not only
<br>makes the buttons ALWAYS work, but also gives them a 'snap' action,
<br>compared to the mushy feel of the original buttons. The switches I
<br>use are small enough to fit under the original rubber buttons, so
<br>expect for them to work and feel different; you can't tell from the
<br>outside that any change has been made. If anyone is interested in
<br>having their sticks retro-fitted with these superior buttons, let
<br>me know.
<p>5.22 - REPLACING AND REPAIRING 5200 CONTROLLERS
<br>-----------------------------------------------
<p>One of the most "beat upon" parts of the joystick are the "fire"
<br>buttons. The good news is that they can be replaced easily.
<p>First you will need to order replacement parts. I recommend
<br>replacing all the internal parts except for the pots (unless you
<br>experience specific difficulties with them). Best Electronics offers
<br>the following:
<p>SPARE PARTS
<br>Description Quantity per joystick Part # $$$
<br>----------- --------------------- ------ ---
<br>Fire Buttons 2 (provides 4 buttons) C020501 $2
<br>Start/Pause/Reset Buttons 1 C018128 $2.50
<br>Numeric Keypad 1 C018126 $2.50
<br>Internal Flex Circuit 1 C018124 $2.50
<br>Controller Boot 1 C021084 $0.50
<br>Boot Retaining Ring 1 C018116 $0.20
<br>Total per joystick 7 $10.20
<p>What Now??
<p>1. Use a knife to remove the plastic bezel containing the Start,
<br>Pause &amp; Reset buttons.
<p>2. Remove the 3 screws holding the joystick together.
<p>3. Use a screwdriver, at the base, to seperate the two halves of the
<br>joystick.
<p>4. Remove the fire buttons from each side, making sure to save the
<br>plastic bezel that holds them in (you'll need this when
<br>installing the new Fire buttons).
<p>5. Remove the old flex circuit. It was probably attached with
<br>double-sided tape. Replace this tape when installing the new
<br>flex circuit. First make certain the new circuit fits well, then
<br>add the tape.
<p>6. Replace the fire buttons mounted in their plastic bezels.
<p>7. Center the numeric keypad on top of the flex circuit. Use the
<br>top half of the joystick to estimate where it should fit. Also
<br>use the guide pegs that align the FC into place.
<p>8. Before re-attaching the joystick, make sure the pots are oriented
<br>correctly so that you maximize the chance that the stick will
<br>line up properly.
<p>The correct position of the pots are:
<p>Top pot peg positioned at 10 O'clock.
<br>Bottom pot peg positioned at 6 O'clock.
<p>9. Re-attach the top half of the joystick. Make sure you feed the
<br>flex circuit for the start/pause/reset buttons through the slot
<br>on the left. Also make sure the joystick handle fits into the
<br>cup in between the two pots.
<p>10. Before replacing the screws in the bottom, slowly move the
<br>joystick handle around to see if it "feel like it's in place.
<p>11. If it feels good, replace the screws.
<p>How do you tell if it is lined up properly?
<p>Play a game like Missile Command or any game that features up/down
<br>movement as well as side-to-side. If one or more dircections fail
<br>you will need to reopen the joystick and follow from instruction #8
<br>above.
<p>===============================================
<br>6.0) ALTERNATIVES TO THE STANDARD CONTROLLERS
<br>===============================================
<p>5200 gamers, rejoice! For individuals who have long suffered at the
<br>hands of the unreliable and imprecise (for some games) standard 5200
<br>controllers, there are a slew of alternatives which are mentioned
<br>below.
<p>6.1 -- THIRD PARTY JOYSTICK CONTROLLERS
<br>---------------------------------------
<p>Wico Command Control Joystick (by Wico)
<br>A decent alternative to the original controllers, the Wico is an
<br>analog stick which comes with a Y-cable which enables the 5200
<br>joystick to be used for keypad functions.
<p>Competition Pro Joystick (by Coin Controls)
<br>An excellent alternative to the standard 5200 joystick, this
<br>controller is a ball-handled microswitch joystick that offers
<br>tremendous feel and control for most games. Highly recommended.
<p>Fire Command Joystick (GIM Electronics)
<br>Unlike the aformentioned two "hand held" controllers, the Fire
<br>Command Joystick is an arcade-style tabletop joystick with a
<br>sturdy metallic base. It features two fire buttons on each side
<br>of the joystick, allowing for lefties to get in on the fun. The
<br>fire buttons are carbon copies of arcade buttons as well. A
<br>definite winner.
<p>6.2 -- MASTERPLAY INTERFACE (by Electra Concepts)
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is THE device to have for any collector or die-hard gamer. The
<br>handy plug-in unit allows 5200 owners to replace the system's analog
<br>joystick with any number of 2600-compatible, digital joysticks. In
<br>addition, the Interface features a slide switch so that a digital
<br>joystick can be used in either a remote 'start' mode or a 'fire'
<br>model depending upon the game. A second slide switch lets you keep
<br>the unit permanently connected to the console so that the analog
<br>controller functions, including the use of the keyboard portion by
<br>itself, can be accomplished simply and easily. The Masterplay
<br>Interface originally came packaged with a second fire button for
<br>games that require it. This button can either be taped or velcroed
<br>to the 2600-compatible controller.

<p>Notice there are four unused inputs on the 4069. These could
<br>potentially be used for other things, like a rapid-fire circuit.
<br>If you're not going to use them, tie the inputs (pins 5, 9, 11,
<br>and 13) to ground.
<p>Function
<br>--------
<p>* Pushing east on the stick grounds the horizontal circuit, mimicking
<br>the effect of infinite resistance between pot common and H-pot.
<br>* Pushing west causes a short circuit between pot common and H-pot,
<br>i.e. zero resistance.
<br>* The fire button works exactly like it does on the regular 5200
<br>controller.
<br>* If you're using a Genesis controller, button B functions as the
<br>bottom fire button, and button C as the top.
<p>Good Things
<br>-----------
<p>* No more problems with games that were unplayable with your non-
<br>centering 5200 sticks.
<br>* Cheap! It only costs about eleven dollars on the raw materials for
<br>one of these, including some rather fancy touches (Y-adapter,
<br>switchable analog stick, etc.)
<br>* It should work with every 2600 joystick there is. I've tested it
<br>with my mechanical switch sticks, my Genesis-to-7800 pad, my
<br>NES-to-7800 pad, and my 2600 remote control joysticks, and they all
<br>work peachy keen.
<p>Bad Things
<br>----------
<p>* 2600 sticks don't have two fire buttons. If you want, you can glue
<br>an extra fire button onto your 2600-compatible stick of choice.
<br>Just wire it up between port pins 14 and 15.
<br>* Won't work with games that require the analog capabilities of the
<br>5200 stick, like Missile Command. A few other games like Galaxian
<br>and Centipede make limited use of the analog-osity of the regular
<br>stick by giving two movement speeds depending on how far you push
<br>the stick. With the adapter, you can only get the fastest speed.
<br>It's not a huge handicap, but it's probably worth mentioning.
<br>* Neither this adapter nor the Masterplay Interface gets along well
<br>with three particular games: Qix, Vanguard and Ms.Pac-Man. There
<br>are others, but I haven't gotten around to trying it on all the
<br>games yet. They will respond to pushing east (or south) on the
<br>stick as if you're pushing west (or north). No real clue exactly
<br>why this happens, but you may be able to make them work by starting
<br>up a game, thrashing the digital stick around until the game
<br>behaves itself, then starting a new game. It might work for you,
<br>and it might not. YMMV.
<p>6.4 -- PC ANALOG JOYSTICK TO 5200 ADAPTER
<br>-----------------------------------------
<p>Yes, you can build an adapter Y-cable for the 5200 to allow the use
<br>of a PC analog joystick. You plug the Atari 5200 controller into one
<br>connecter to use its keypad. You plug a PC joystick into the other
<br>connecter for movement and buttons. Great for Star Raiders and
<br>Galaxian. OK for Super Breakout if you have a steady hand.
<p>How to Connect a PC Joystick to an Atari 5200 System
<br>(Revision 1.0)
<br>5/24/96
<p>This is an adapter for connecting a PC joystick to an Atari 5200.
<br>It's a small cable with two 15 pin connectors on one end and
<br>one 15 pin connector on the other. The single connector end plugs
<br>into the A5200. One the other end, one connector is for a PC
<br>joystick and the other is for an Atari 5200 controller. The keypad
<br>and top row buttons are used on the 5200 controller as usual. The PC
<br>joystick replaces the A5200 direction control and fire buttons.
<p>Any PC compatible joystick will work, but some PC compatible
<br>joystick are digital instead of analog. These seem mostly of the
<br>joypad variety. You can still use digital joysticks, but some games
<br>will not work. Super Breakout is the big one that is impossible to
<br>play with a digital PC joystick (Well you can, but the paddle can
<br>only be all the way left, all the way right, or in the middle).
<br>Games like Pac-man and Defender play no different with a digital PC
<br>joystick. However, I have noticed, that games like Galaxian and Star
<br>Raiders play better with an analog joystick. For example the ship in
<br>Galaxian has two speeds in each direction. Moving the stick a little
<br>to the left will move the ship slowly to the left and moving the
<br>stick all the way to the left will move the ship at a faster speed.
<br>So these games are still playable with a digital joystick but won't
<br>have the same feel as an analog joystick.
<p>For the serious gamers, I would recommend an analog joystick
<br>with trimmer controls. The trimmers allow optimum sensitivity
<br>adjustment and as a bonus you can play Super Breakout with just the
<br>trimmer control. There's one from Quickshot called the Warrior 5
<br>that is only $10. If you have a joystick without trimmers like the
<br>Thrustmaster, it still works, but it seems more sensitive in one
<br>direction than another. This can be fixed by playing with different
<br>capacitor values.
<p>Some of you may be wondering about calibration. I can't confirm
<br>this, but from my observations, there is some auto calibration going
<br>on. For example, I put in Galaxian, and press start. My ship starts
<br>moving right even though I'm in the neutral position. However, If I
<br>move all the way left and all the way right, the ship always stops
<br>when I'm in neutral position. I have observed this behavior with my
<br>adapter as well as the Atari 5200 controller.
<p>I have also been asked about the Gravis PC Gamepad. I don't know
<br>for sure, but I believe the Gravis PC Gamepad is digital. Feel
<br>free to correct me if I am wrong. If it is, it comes under the same
<br>restrictions discussed above.
<p>If anybody is interested in making these adapters to sell, you have
<br>my permission. All I ask is that somewhere you give me credit for
<br>the design.
<p>Now the Disclaimer. I am not responsible for:
<p>1. Any damage done to your A5200
<br>2. Any damage done to your PC Joystick.
<br>3. Any errors in these instructions or schematic.
<p>I'm not going to give step by step instructions. I'm going to
<br>assume that the reader has some basic knowledge of electronics and
<br>can figure out what to do with the schematics and info presented
<br>here. I will, however, answer questions if asked.
<p>Now that I covered my backside, here is how to do it:

<p>Notes:
<br>------
<p>1. Wire up one end of the cable to a 15 pin female connector. This
<br>will be the connector that goes to the Atari 5200. Wire the
<br>other two connectors to the other end of the cable.
<p>2. The value of the capacitors is not critical. If the PC joystick
<br>has a trimmer, a slightly smaller or larger value should work.
<p>3. The type of capacitor is not important. If polarized caps are
<br>used, connect the negative leads to the 15---4 wire.
<p>4. Because the Atari 5200 joystick connector is so deep, using a
<br>clam shell cover for this adapter connector makes it very loose.
<br>I recommend heat shrink tubing or electrical tape on this end.
<p>6.5 -- CONVERTING A STANDARD 5200 JOYSTICK TO A PADDLE CONTROLLER
<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>The analog 5200 joystick makes it perfect for a paddle conversion,
<br>right? Now there's a way to convert your joystick into a paddle
<br>controller.
<p>PARTS required: at least one *paddle* from an Atari 2600 (not from
<br>the driving controller) and one 5200 joystick controller.
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: This project disables the horizontal capability of
<br>the 5200 stick which is assumed by the paddle controller. This
<br>works great for games like Breakout and Space Invaders but is less
<br>useful for things like Mario Brothers... Although the process is
<br>potentially reversible, it is recommended that you use a spare 5200
<br>controller.
<p>Take the 2600 paddle and cut one of the control cables right behind
<br>the end of the 9-pin connector. (I'm not sure if cutting off one
<br>paddle will still leave the other active for one-player games since
<br>I was operating with a defective pair. If anyone experiments with
<br>this, drop me a note.)
<p>Open up the paddle and note the color of the wire connections to the
<br>pot (two wires) and fire button (two wires.) There should be three
<br>terminals on the pot. Unsolder the wire on the outside terminal
<br>(i.e. not the middle one) and solder it to the opposite side. If you
<br>don't do this, the paddle will cause the cursor to move in the wrong
<br>direction.
<p>Close up the 2600 controller and open up the 5200 controller. I
<br>used a small file to make a notch in the top half of the 5200
<br>controller just below the silver logo plate. The U-shaped notch I
<br>made allows for the paddle cable to slip into it and be held in place
<br>when the 5200 controller is reassmbled. One you have a satisfactory
<br>test fit, you are ready to wire the controllers together.
<p>For convenenience, I will use the following colors based on the
<br>paddle I used. If your colors are different, make the appropriate
<br>substitutions:
<p>red- paddle pot, center terminal
<br>yellow - paddle pot, "outside" terminal
<br>brown - fire button
<br>black - fire button
<p>Take the open 5200 contrller and detach both wires from the
<br>horizontal pot (the "lower" pot, closest to the numeric keypad.)
<br>Connect the paddle yellow wire to the black wire from the 5200 pot
<br>(although removed from the horizontal pot, it will remain connected
<br>to the other pot.) Connect the red paddle wire to the brown wire
<br>from the 5200 pot.
<p>The remaining two paddle need to be connected "across" one of the
<br>lower 5200 buttons (to allow the paddle button to fire the ball in
<br>breakout.) You can do this by carefully scraping off the plastic
<br>from the traces going to each side of one of the lower buttons and
<br>carefully soldering the black and brown paddle wires to each side of
<br>the button. I chose to locate the on the outermost trace running
<br>down the left side of the numeric keypad and the brown wire on the
<br>next to outermost trace running down the right side of the numeric
<br>keypad. You may have to trim the keypad gasket edges slightly to
<br>clear these wires and allow it to lie flat.
<p>The new paddle-joystick may be tested before reassembly. Pop in the
<br>Breakout cartridge and select a game. The button on the paddle
<br>should fire the ball to start the game and the paddle (which can also
<br>be tested before the game is started) should move the onscreen paddle
<br>left and right just like on the 2600.
<p>If everything seems to be working ok, reassemble the 5200 stick with
<br>the paddle cable threaded out the side and enjoy! Be careful to
<br>route the paddle wires so they aren't crushed by any of the plastic
<br>supports in the 5200 stick and aren't in the way of the screw holes!
<p>If you've felt that the joystick just doesn't cut it for 5200 Super
<br>Breakout, Kaboom and others, you now have a solution! Contact
<br>themaverick@volcano.net for questions about this conversion.

<br>7.0) ATARI 5200 EMULATORS
<br>===========================
<p>VIRTUAL SUPER SYSTEM (VSS)
<br>--------------------------
<p>Dan Boris's Emulator Page
<br>http://www.atarihq.com/danb/emulate.htm
<p>VSS (Virtual SuperSystem) is arguably the best Atari 5200 emulator
<br>among those that are currently available. It's for MS-DOS, and
<br>it's FREE. The current version runs about 95% of the ROM images I
<br>have almost flawlessly, and at a reasonable speed even on a 486
<br>DX2/66. On a Pentium system the emulator gets close to, or better
<br>than full speed on a lot of games. To use this emulator you will
<br>need a copy of the 5200's 2K BIOS ROM, and 5200 ROM cart images.
<p>Unlike all the other emulators in this roundup, VSS is a dedicated,
<br>5200-only emulator.
<p>RAINBOW
<br>-------
<p>Rainbow Emulator Page
<br>http://www.chrislam.co.uk/
<p>Rainbow is an Atari 8-Bit Emulator that allows Atari 8-bit Computer
<br>and 5200 game images to run on the Macintosh or Windows95/NT.
<br>Currently, only a preview demo is downloadable for Win95/NT, with
<br>the shareware version expected momentarily. A full shareware
<br>version for the Macintosh has been available for some time.
<p>Here's a quick rundown of key features in the full shareware version:
<p>* Accepts 16K and 32K ROMs for 5200.
<br>* Fast full and medium screen displays.
<br>* True 256 Atari colors.
<br>* Full ANTIC/GTIA graphics, namely all ANTIC modes, Player/Missile
<br>Graphics, fine scrolling and Display List interrupts.
<br>* Four joysticks (via keypad) and four paddles (using mouse)
<p>POKEY
<br>-----
<p>Pokey Emulator Page
<br>Homepage Unavailable
<p>Pokey, like VSS, is a free Atari Computer emulator for DOS that
<br>can also emulate the 5200 if you have the 5200's 2K BIOS ROM.
<br>It is one of the earlier Atari 5200 emulators and is quite
<br>outdated. For instance, the only way you can get sound is if
<br>you build yourself a Pokey sound card and install it.
<p>Current Pokey features:
<p>* 320 X 200 screen (scrollable) or Mode X (320 X 240 or 360 X 240)
<br>* Supports two PC joysticks (swapple on the fly or upon loading)
<br>* DLI and VBI supported.
<br>* All ANTIC modes.
<br>* Player-missile graphics with collision detection
<br>* GTIA graphics
<br>* Horizontal and vertical fine scrolling
<br>* System monitor.

<p>This is a fine Atari 8-bit computer and 5200 emulator for Unix,
<br>Amiga, MS-DOS and Falcon and was originally written by David Firth.
<br>The 5200 mode currently support about 80% of all ROM images, which
<br>is slightly less than what VSS currently manages to achieve. With
<br>sound turned on, you will need a fast (Pentium II) PC to run at
<br>full speed.
