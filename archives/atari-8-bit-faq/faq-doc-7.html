<H1>2.1) What is comp.sys.atari.8bit?</H1>
<PRE>
news:comp.sys.atari.8bit is the unmoderated Usenet newsgroup for discussion
about the Atari 8-bit family of computers, including the 400, 800, 1200XL,
600XL, 800XL, 65XE, 130XE, 800XE and the XE Game System!

comp.sys.atari.8bit was born around 1986-87 when the earlier comp.sys.atari
newsgroup was split into comp.sys.atari.8bit and comp.sys.atari.st.

Large binary posts do not belong in unmoderated discussion groups like
comp.sys.atari.8bit.  If you wish to share PD/freeware/shareware, use
alt.binaries.atari and alt.binaries.atari.d or upload the software to the
University of Michigan Atari Archive.

To the best of my knowledge, there is no charter for comp.sys.atari.8bit,
presumably because the custom of drafting charters for new newsgroups did not
exist at that time.
