 The question is: "How do I type the tilde or squigly line which is in
 most web addresses?  I don't have a key for it..."

 Answer: The tilde is an inverse backspace on the Atari 8-Bit which can
 be very hard to type depending on the term program you are using,
 however you can insert the hex equivalent very easily, which is %7e in
 place of the tilde and it will work just perfectly.  Do not put a space
 either before or after the %7e.

I (Michael) add:

 Some advanced Atari software supports the tilde character natively.  E.g.,
 you can type a tilde in Ice-T with the Atari Logo/Inverse Video key.
