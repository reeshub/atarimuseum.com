Here is a very condensed history of Atari, centered around their 8-bit
computers.

1972
Atari Inc. is formed by Nolan Bushnell, incorporated on Tuesday, June 27.
Atari created the first coin-operated arcade video game with the introduction
of Pong. The video game industry was launched and has shaped pop culture ever
since.

1976
Warner Communications acquires Atari Inc.

1977
Atari launches the Video Computer System (VCS), giving birth to home
video game systems.

1978
In December, Atari announces the Atari 400 and 800 personal computers, using
the 6502 microprocessor. The Atari 800 was code-named "Colleen"; the 400,
"Candy."

The following are most of the team who originally designed the 400/800.

1979
The Atari 400 and Atari 800 Home Computers debut at the Winter Consumer
Electronics Show (CES) in early January.

Jerry Jessop, mailto:jjessop1@home.com writes:
  "The first official small shipment of the 400/800 was on August 29th 1979.
  These were hand built pilot run units to Sears that needed to be in stock by
  Sept. 1 so they could be placed in the big fall catalog. The units were
  placed in the Sears warehouse and then immediatly returned to Atari after
  the "in stock" requirment had been meet.

  The first "real" consumer units were shipped in Nov. of 79 and were 400's to
  Sears followed very shortly by 800's."

These MOS Technology 6502-based systems run at a clock speed of 1.79 MHz,
offering 128 colors displayable simultaneously, up to 320x192 graphics
resolution and up to 40x24 text resolution in 8 graphics modes and 6 text
modes.  Video may be displayed either on a composite video monitor in the case
of the 800, or on a standard television for both systems.  4 independent sound
voices are available through the audio output of the television or monitor,
each with a 3 1/2 octave range, plus there is a built-in speaker for key-click
and other programmable sounds.  The 800 has a second cartridge port and a
full-stroke keyboard, while the 400 has a single cartridge port and a membrane
keyboard.  Each has 4 serial controller ports and an Atari Serial Input/Output
port.  Originally, both the 400 and 800 were sold with 8K RAM, but later most
800's were sold with 48K and 400's with 16K.  Each includes the 10K Atari
Operating System in ROM.

The 800 can be fitted with 1-3 of the following two RAM modules:
CX852 8K RAM module, CX853 16K RAM module
and must be fitted with a ROM module:
CX801 10K ROM, CX801-P 10K ROM for PAL machines

1981
November: 400/800's begin shipping with the new GTIA chip in place of CTIA,
increasing the palette of simultaneously displayable colors to 256 and adding
3 new graphics modes.  CTIA is totally phased out by the end of the year.

Jerry Jessop, mailto:jjessop1@home.com adds:
  "The very first proto systems did have the GTIA, but it had some
  problems and was not released in the consumer version until 1981. The
  GTIA was completed before the CTIA."

1982
The introduction of the 1200XL in late 1982 marks the single largest advance
in the 8-bit Atari system.  The 1200XL runs most software and hardware
designed for the 800 and 400, but now runs a slightly more advanced 6502C
microprocessor, and includes a full 64K RAM.  The single cartridge and monitor
ports remain, along with 2 controller ports.  In addition, the 1200XL includes
4 programmable Function keys and a Help key, built-in diagnostic and graphics
demonstration programs, and probably the favorite keyboard of any 8-bit Atari
computer.  Clicks previously outputted through the built-in speaker are now
heard from the television or monitor's speaker.  The revised 16K Operating
System offers many new features, including an alternate International
Character Set.

1983
In 1983 Atari replaced the 1200XL/800/400 line-up with the new 800XL and
600XL.  These new machines include most of the features of the 1200XL minus
the Function keys and the demo program.  But now both the 800XL and 600XL
have the Atari BASIC language built-in.  In addition, these two systems
offer the Parallel Buss Interface (PBI), providing direct memory access to the
heart of the computer.  The 800XL contains 64K RAM while the 600XL has 16K RAM.

The 600XL can be expanded from 16K to 64K with the 1064 Atari Memory Module.

1984
Warner Communications sells Consumer Electronics and Home Computer
divisions of Atari Inc. to Tramiel Technologies on Monday, July 2.

Atari Corporation is formed by Tramiel Technologies and its products marketed
under the Atari brand.

 (
   Atari Games Corporation is also formed from the former coin-op
   division and markets coin-op games under the Atari Games brand.

   Today Atari Games is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the
   Midway Games division of WMS Industries.

   WMS Industries, Inc.: <A NAME=id4 HREF="http://www.wms.com/">http://www.wms.com/</A>
 )

1985
The new Atari Corp. delivered on its promise to advance the 8-bit Atari system
by replacing the 800XL/600XL with the new 130XE and 65XE in 1985. The 65XE is
nearly identical to the 800XL in features, minus the PBI. The 130XE, however,
offers 128K RAM, plus the FREDDY chip, supporting the unique (but rarely used)
ability for the 6502C and the ANTIC to independently access RAM banks.  In
addition, the 130XE replaces the PBI port with the Enhanced Cartridge
Interface (ECI), continuing the powerful feature of direct memory access.
European 65XE's include the ECI port.

1987
In a change of marketing strategy, Atari introduced the new XE Game System
in 1987.  Despite its label, the XEGS is a true 8-bit Atari computer system.
It offers the convenience of a detachable keyboard and built-in Missile
Command game, while offering 64K RAM and full compatibility with the 65XE.

The 800XE, a 130XE with just 64K, was released at some point in eastern
Europe.  [WHEN???]

1992
Atari officially dropped all remaining support of their 8-bit computer line on
January 1, 1992.

1996
On July 31, 1996, Atari Corp. became a JTS subsidiary.  JTS Corp., with
headquarters in San Jose, Calif., was founded in 1994 to design,
manufacture and
supply enhanced-capacity hard disk drives for the notebook and desktop personal
computer markets.

1998
On February 23, 1998, JTS sold its Atari Division to HIACXI Corp., a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Hasbro,
Inc., for $5 million in cash.

Hasbro Interactive, Inc. is a leading all-family interactive games
publisher, formed in 1995 to bring to life on the computer the deep library
of toy and board games of parent company, Hasbro, Inc. (AMEX:HAS).
Hasbro Interactive has expanded its charter to include original and licensed
games for the PC, the Sony PlayStation(tm) and for multi-player gaming over
the Internet. Headquartered in Beverly, Massachusetts, Hasbro Interactive
has offices in the U.K., France, Germany, Japan and Canada.
