Revision : 1.0
Date.... : 4/20/1997

 ==============================================================
   !!!! This section is under construction - HELP WANTED !!!!
 --------------------------------------------------------------
  The goal is to give information about all available languages
  for the Atari 8-bit computer. This information will include;
  title, last version, author, date and a short description.
  It would also be nice to know how to get it and where to get
  more information (like reference cards, reviews and such).

  Some resources:
  - The Multi-lingual Atari, Analog magazine 45, August 1986
  - Assembler Interchange Format, Project description
    Version 2.2, 2-2-1997, Freddy Offenga

  If you like to help or if you've something to add already,
  just contact me. There's still a lot work to be done....
