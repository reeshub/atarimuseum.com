<H1>11.3) Can I read/write MS-DOS disks on an 8-bit Atari?</H1>
<PRE>
a) Mule by Rick Cortese - Read/Write 180K MS-DOS disks with an Atari 1050
drive or equivalent.  Very limited.
  filenames: Diskutils/mule.arc, Diskutils/mule.exe, Diskutils/mule.txt

b) SIO2PC, described elsewhere in this FAQ List (section 11.5), can be
used to read/write to a hard drive connected to an MS-DOS system.  This
can also be a very effective file-transfer solution.

c) The XF551 3.5" Upgrades from Computer Software Services (see the
companion vendor/developer list) allow the Atari XF551 disk drive to read
720K 3.5" MS-DOS disks.

d) The Floppy Board, the add-on to the Black-Box from Computer Software
Services (see the companion vendor/developer list), allows both low
density (360K 5.25", 720K 3.5"), and, in the case of the Deluxe
Version, high density (1.2M 5.25", 1.44M 3.5") external MS-DOS-standard
floppy drives to be used on the Atari.  A utility is included to
read/write MS-DOS formatted floppies in all supported densities.
