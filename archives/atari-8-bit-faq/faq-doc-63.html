<H1>14.7) What is the HARD-Interlacing-Picture (HIP) format?</H1>
<PRE>
HIP is a new method to displaing pictures on small atari...

HIP stands for HARD-Interlacing-Picture and was found by
Members of HARD Software, Hungary in June, July 1996...

It enables to display 160 x 240 Pixels with 30 shades without
nearly all flickering (depends on the source-picture you use)...
HARD stands not for HARD or HEAVY Interlacing, just for the
inventors...
