<PRE>
Atari BASIC:

At the READY prompt, enter "? PEEK(43234)"

If the result is:  You have Revision:
     162                  A
     96                   B
     234                  C

Freddy Offenga, mailto:offen300@hio.tem.nhl.nl adds:

there's another good answer (IMO):

You can also take a look at the part numbers on the IC's
inside your Atari and compare them with the numbers from
the following table:

Part#                  Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~
CO12402 + CO14502         A
CO60302A                  B
CO24947A                  C


CTIA or GTIA installed?

In BASIC, type POKE 623,64 [RETURN] and if the screen blackens, you have the
GTIA chip.  If it stays blue, you have the old CTIA chip.

By the way, apparently no CTIA-equipped Ataris were shipped to Europe.
