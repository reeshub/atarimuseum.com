<H1>9.2) What is an .arc file?</H1>
<PRE>
     A file with the extender .arc has been archived in a standard manner that
is common in the MS-DOS world.  This is done to make the file shorter,
so it takes up less space on your disk and it takes less time to transfer
between computers.  The archives contains several 8-bit Atari archivers
fully compatible with this standard, including:

Super Un-Arc 2.3, Super Arc 2.0 by Bob Puff - highly recommended.
  filenames:   Archivers/superarc.arc - both Super Un-Arc &#38; Super Arc
               Archivers/suprarc2.arc - Super Arc
               Archivers/supunarc.com - Super Un-Arc
               Archivers/supunarc.uue - Super Un-Arc
