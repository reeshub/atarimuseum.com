==&#62; #atari8 - Just for 8-bit Atari users!

Paul Clark offers this tip:

                I think Dalnet carries #atari8, do the following;

               <A NAME=id121 HREF=" telnet://telnet.dal.net"> telnet://telnet.dal.net</A>

                At the login prompt, type;

                dalnet

                If prompted for a password, just hit enter. You should
        be able to navigate to #atari8 from there.......

If you have access to a Unix host then you should be able to get to irc by
typing irc at your shell prompt and jumping on an EFnet server
(irc.portal.com, irc.eskimo.com, dewey.cc.utexas.edu) and joining #atari8.

If you are using a host that has a menu system then locate IRC and go there,
and join #atari8 (and hope your on EFnet, :).

If you are using SLIP/PPP then download a client (for Windows users, download
mIRC for Winsock archives, and I would guess that most SLIP/PPP users -- if
they have gotten that far -- are familiar with IRC, :) and select one of
the servers and join #atari8.  There is many IRC servers on EFnet, chances
are the one your on is on EFnet.
