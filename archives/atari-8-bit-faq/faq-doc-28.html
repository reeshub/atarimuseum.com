<H1>9.4) What are the .XMO and .BIN file formats?</H1>
<PRE>
XMO stands for XMODEM.  The idea was that the file was not plain text,
but was a binary file.  As a binary file, it had to be downloaded using a
file transfer protocol such as XMODEM.  The use of ".xmo" as a filename
extender was popular once, but has been discouraged for years.

BIN - another filename extension sometimes used to designate binary-load
files.  Like .xmo, use of .bin is discouraged.
