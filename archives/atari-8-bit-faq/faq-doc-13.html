<PRE>
XL Search is a new and growing search engine created and maintained by
mailto:kendrick@zippy.sonoma.edu (Bill Kendrick), designed to provide much-
improved access to the various PD/freeware/shareware Atari 8-bit software
archives available on the Internet.

XL Search is located at: <A NAME=id8 HREF="http://zippy.sonoma.edu/kendrick/nbs/xlsearch/">http://zippy.sonoma.edu/kendrick/nbs/xlsearch/</A>

You can also access XL Search via e-mail! Send mail to:
mailto:kendrick@zippy.sonoma.edu with the subject "xlsearch" for details.

<A NAME=id9 HREF="http://shareware.com/">http://shareware.com/</A> , c|net's FTP-site search engine, now includes
the Atari 8-bit files at UMich!

Unfortunately, being under the previously-existing "Atari" category,
the files are now pretty mixed in with the ST stuff.  I've talked to them
about fixing that.  No reponse yet (they're really slow that way)...

Anyway, so now you can use <A NAME=id10 HREF="http://shareware.com/">http://shareware.com/</A> to find Atari stuff..
just be careful what directory you pull it out of! :)

Remember, you can ALSO use MY MINI VERSION OF SHAREWARE.COM!....

XL Search, the Atari 8-bit FTP site search engine!
If anything, it's much less cluttered than Shareware.com! ;)
