<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Atari Pinball Manufacturing Building.&nbsp;&nbsp;
From 1976-1978 Atari developed some of the most impressive</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and memorable pinball games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nolan Bushnell knew Atari could not compete with the likes of</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Williams and others in the Pinball arena
with low priced pinballs, it simply couldn't be done at a lower cost,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">so as always he chose a better route...&nbsp;&nbsp;
Innovate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari created games which were more complex
and challenging,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">larger and more eye catching.&nbsp; That
more then made up for the higher costs of the Pinball games.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; When Warner Communications looked
at the pinball division and attempted to find ways to cost reduce</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the games and found there just wasn't
any way to make them cheaper, they tentatively closed the Pinball</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Division and announced it would return
in 1982 with all new Pinball games.&nbsp; However Superman would</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">be Atari's final Pinball game and with
the Consumer Market earnings down and the Christmas season</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">nose dive of Warner stock due to lower
then expected sales from the Atari subsidiary, the Pinball Division</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">would never saw the light of day again.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Gary Rubio, former Atari Consumer Division
engineer recalls...</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"1173 was later the home of the Consumer</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Electronics Division (CED) Quality,
Reliability and Safety (QRS) group which</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">was managed by Chuck Weller, now a
real estate agent.&nbsp; This is where the</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">CX-52 joystick was eventually life
tested, and where the concept of the</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">CX-52P was developed &amp; introduced.&nbsp;
Sadly, I never knew the original history</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of the building you mention.&nbsp;
It was never discussed by the time I arrived</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">in 1982.&nbsp; 1173 was the first building
I worked for Atari.&nbsp; As I recall, the</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">first things I was working on were
(besides trying to collect games for the</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">5200 machine every new employee was
allowed to carry home for free),</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">collecting spare pieces of Atari computer
parts to build my own Atari800</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">computer, playing the 5200 games, trying
to figure out why the 5200 joystick</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">controller boot kept tearing, supporting
new LC (low cost) designs on the</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">5200 and peripherals, including the
eventual surface mount VCS which was</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">about 2.5 x 3.5"&nbsp; Have you ever
seen this?&nbsp; (It's inside one of those two</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">boxes I built that was a remote control
VCS and a plug-in box that adapted</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">any existing x-y joystick into remote
control).&nbsp; I eventually became what I</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">would call the "OOEM", the "original
original equipment manufacturer"</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">interface for game hardware and peripherals.&nbsp;
What this means is outside</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">vendors would come to me with their
designs, and I would plug them in and</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">see if they would work, or what it
would take to convert them to work.</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Atari was so busy trying to build different
(and possibly cheaper) versions</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of the VCS and PAM, that outside people
were drooling so badly for new Atari</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">products they were designing them themselves,
and coming to Atari to make</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">money from Atari on Atari-compatible
devices.&nbsp; And, some succeeded, Cynex</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">remote control joystick to mention
one.&nbsp; Later GCC came along with the 7800,</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and I was the natural interface to
introduce that product to many Atarians.</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sadly, less than a year later, and
about 6 months too soon for a successful</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">introduction of the 7800, "BlakJak"
Jack Tramiel bought the company and that</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">was the end of that."</font></i></center>
