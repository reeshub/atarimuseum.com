# Atari Museum Unofficial Mirror

The original proprietor of The Atari Museum, the hugely respected computing historian Curt Vendel, sadly unexpectedly [passed away aged 53 on August 30th 2020](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gaming-historian-curt-vendel-dies-at-53). This website became inaccessible around a year later when its hosting expired.

Having personally used this website and its predecessor atari-history.com for research over the years, it seemed such a shame for Curt's life's work to not be indexed and available on the wider web, so I took it upon myself to mirror it here in as complete a form as I could piece together. This mirror is based upon [the Wayback Machine's 2021-07-16 14:12 crawl of atarimuseum.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20210716141211/http://www.atarimuseum.com/), the last available before it went offline.

I have made no changes to the content or layout, only manually checking every page and fixing broken links and images where I find them - and adding this explanatory page. You can see the reconstruction and cleanup process via the commits to this GitHub repo.

As a fellow fan of Atari history, my only motivation in making this mirror available is to make his work as accessible as possible in its original form, and I hope it is received by the community as intended. While I have no personal connection to Curt, he was a hero and inspiration of mine and we had some good chats on Facebook over the years, so I like to think that he would approve. May he Rest In Peace knowing that his efforts were not in vain.

## Outstanding Issues
While this is the most complete mirror of this site that I know of, there are still a few bugs for me to iron out.
- Atari Video Game Systems / Cartridge Consoles / Jaguar / Jaguar File Store: oberon.zip is missing and I have been unable to track it down. From what I can see, this was never uploaded in the first place.
- Atari Video Game Systems / Cartridge Consoles / Jaguar / Jaguar File Store: jagfiles2.zip is over 100MB and therefore too big for GitHub, so that link is also broken for now.
- Atari Computer Systems / XL / 1400XL: 1400xl-schems.zip, the schematics for the 1400XL prototype, isn't included as it's over GitHub's 100MB filesize limit.
- Atari Computer Systems / XL / Peripherals & Prototypes: The page for the 1025 printer is missing. As far as I can see, this never existed on either atarimuseum.com nor its predecessor atari-history.com.
- Atari Documents / Files Archive: "Top" image missing from "Industry Doubts..." article.
- Atari Documents / Files Archive: "Cloak & Dagger: The Inside Story" article is missing. Whether this was missing originally or not archived due to the "&" in the filename is unknown at this time.
- Atari Documents / Files Archive / Magazine Archives / Atari Age: Issue v2n5 actually links to v2n6, which doesn't exist. Unfortunately this either never got uploaded or hasn't been crawled due to the broken link, so I can't track it down.
- Atari Documents / Files Archive / Magazine Archives / Atari I/O: The Wayback machine has been reporting this as a 404 since it first appeared in 2009, so I'm guessing it was never uploaded.
- Atari Documents / Files Archive / Magazine Archives / Coin Connection: This collection seems *very* incomplete but it appears that it has always been that way.
- Atari Documents / Files Archive / Video Library: Still working my way through this so should probably be considered incomplete.
