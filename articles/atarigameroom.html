the ominous black and white sing that warns against smoking, eating and
drinking, is a world that is anything but ominous.&nbsp; From behind that
sign-bearing door, strange sound are to be heard.&nbsp; Whiz!, Bang!, Ka-Pow!&nbsp;
Screeching brankes.&nbsp; Crashing cars.&nbsp; Other worldly bleeps.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rat-a-tat-tats.&nbsp; Pinball bumps and bells.&nbsp; Rock 'n Roll.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not to mention the sound of voices.&nbsp; Person-against-machine sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;
People gritting their teeth, planting their feet firmly on the floor, hands
in position, determined to conquer those machines that they themselves
created.</FONT></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is
this place of sounds?&nbsp; It's the Atari Game Room, located in the CHQ
building, 1265 Borregas.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's an incredible place, filled with
eye-feasting sights.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mirrored walls panel each end of the long
room, reflecting the breathtaking bright colors that overflow the room
no matter where you look.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The place
has an awe-inspiring museum-like quality about it when no one's around.&nbsp;
It's eerily still.&nbsp; Strangely hushed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lights flash in
tantalizing silence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Beckoning anyone to a head-to-head match
of human-against-inhuman wits.&nbsp; The machines wait.&nbsp; Patiently.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Game
Room assaults the senses with a powerful micture of sights and sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Magnificent colors and bold, clean, vivid graphics great the eye with a
machine gun blast.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everywhere
the eye wanders, there is something new waiting to be viewed.&nbsp; And
some machine waiting to be conquered.&nbsp;&nbsp; The jukebox waits too.&nbsp;
Its buttons throbbing to be touched, to set free its music.&nbsp;&nbsp;
All this excitment pulsates&nbsp;<IMG SRC="gameroomgame2.JPG" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=121 WIDTH=177 ALIGN=LEFT>under
the watchful eye and expert care of Steve Upton.&nbsp;&nbsp; He knows the
machines.&nbsp; How to play them.&nbsp; How to win.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact,
he knows them inside and out.&nbsp;&nbsp; He can dismantle a machine at
pinball speed, find the problem, and put it all back together just as quickly.&nbsp;
Good as new.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technically speaking.&nbsp; Steve's real
job at Atari is a Development Tech.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Game Room is just part
of his daily routine.&nbsp;&nbsp; He devotes probably 10-20 hours a week
here, making sure everything is as it should be so Atarians can find total
enjoyment here.</FONT></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve
watches people come and go.&nbsp; Defeated and elated.&nbsp; He knows who's
refined the skills necessary to have an equal contest with the Game Room
machines.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve speaks of the "dual purpose" of the Game Room.&nbsp;
First, it serves as a&nbsp;<IMG SRC="gameroomgame3.JPG" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=152 ALIGN=RIGHT>marketing
tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; To display these magic machines.&nbsp; Vendors, distributors
and sales reps stream in and out, persuing the Atari genius.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the most visible purpose is that extra benefit for everybody employed
by Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp; A place to come during lunch, or on breaks.&nbsp;
A place to left the spirits, sharpen the eye and the coordination, and
pit yourself against there incredible space age toys.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve's
watched the games-- and the popularity of each--come and go.&nbsp; He reesl
off some of the current favorites:&nbsp;<IMG SRC="gameroomgame1.JPG" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=151 ALIGN=LEFT>coin-op's
Sprint 4, Tank 8 and the newest--Breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp; He lists Middle
Earth as the most popular pinball machine.&nbsp; Starship used to dominate
the scene here; Steve notes that each new game enjoys popularity for 4
or 5 months, then some new creation takes over.&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, indulge
yourself in its pleasures.</FONT></FONT>
