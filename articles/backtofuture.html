&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Article was published
in 1996 onto the Fordham Prep BBS in the Bronx, NY (718)-817-5500, Fordham
Prep is a ghost town now, but back in its heyday of the mid-80's it was
one of the most popular BBS' in New York and a great hub for National Message
bases.&nbsp; Around the time this article was posted, the Atari Prototypes
and Vaporware's website was in its early days of creation, prior to this,
there had been an almost 7 year lapse since any official Atari archive
presence of the company and its history from Curt Vendel had been run since
The Earth Access Center BBS had gone off-line in1989 to present Atari articles
and data.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Earth Access Center was an archive and message
base for learning more about Atari, and before that Curt Vendel ran The
Star Trek BBS which was featured in a BBS listing in Antic magazine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The website brought forth finally the medium to take all of the salvaged
items over the years out and take photo's of them for public presentation
and reference.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; During the beginnings of the Atari Historical Society's
presence on the web, Curt Vendel was still frequenting the Bulletin Board
systems tracking down information and history and answering questions to
those who were interested in learning more about Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Curt was also an active member of the CompuServe SIG Atari group and his
email account 75212,2071 has long since been shutdown to move to AOL, then
to AT&amp;T and now Hughes Satellite Services DirecPC.

<br>Article: Back to the Future...
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;There's an powerful craze that has taken over the whole world
in one way or
<br>another, its being referred to as "Retro".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything
from bell bottom pants
<br>to the Brady Bunch movies to disco music to even computers and video
games.
<br>Computers and Video games???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who wants some tired
old 8 bit antiques from
<br>the past?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of people!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; From collectors
to video game buffs everyone
<br>is suddenly looking to the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Arcade games
are becoming more and more
<br>popular.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why with all these incredible 32 and 64
bit systems with graphics
<br>that come as close to cartoons are people suddenly looking to play
those old
<br>blocky and bitty looking relics?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is, game
play.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems these
<br>days that game designers are so busy making their video games look
so
<br>incredible, the game play just isn't the same as the good old day.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the
<br>past during the 70's and the 80's game play was everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Graphics weren't
<br>all that great, so it was important that the game was extremely challenging
and
<br>entertaining in its game play.
<p>&nbsp;Activision and Microsoft have already jumped onto the Retro bandwagon
with
<br>their 2600 game paks and Return the Arcade.&nbsp;&nbsp; Williams released
its Williams
<br>Arcade which not only features classic video games, but also has interviews
<br>with the designers as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The interesting part about
these games is that
<br>they're not cheap imitations, but the actual emulated chip sets running
the
<br>actual ROM software, so every single hidden clue, quirky patterns and
hidden
<br>surprises are all there in tact and waiting to be rediscovered. Many
other
<br>classic arcade hits are on the way soon, the web is buzzing with talk
of
<br>emulators for everything from Asteroids to 5200 and 800XL emulators.
<p>&nbsp;Another interesting phenomenon is taking place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Years
ago when Atari first
<br>released the Atari 2600 "Video Computer System"&nbsp; I was hooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mesmerized by
<br>this incredible machine, I had to have one.&nbsp;&nbsp; I first played
Combat, then
<br>Adventure and it was incredible, the game almost seemed alive, and
intelligent.
<br>I caught the "Atari Bug".&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to have one, even the word
Atari had some
<br>kind of magically alluring power to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; When Atari announced
the Atari
<br>400/800 computers "Innovative Leisure".&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to have one.&nbsp;
I received every
<br>magazine at the time and collected any article that had anything to
do with
<br>Atari's.&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandparents saw how drawn I was to this technology
and purchase
<br>literally anything Atari for me, but there was more...
<p>&nbsp;I began to look deeper and notice things, comments about "other"
equipment to
<br>come, but it never materialized, where was it???&nbsp;&nbsp; There
were pictures and
<br>specifications and pre-release reviews by people who had the honor
of seeing
<br>and using these new machines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Articles about new
computers with built in
<br>modems and speech synthesizers and disk drives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Keyboards
to turn a 2600 into
<br>a computer, articles about a video game called the 7800 with a keyboard
and a
<br>port for disk drives, talk about an Atari with multiple CPU chips for
Atari
<br>DOS, CP/M and even MS-DOS.&nbsp;&nbsp; A box that could have cards
plugged into it like
<br>and Apple ][E and an IBM PC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where were they, I had to
have them, I must have
<br>them...
<p>&nbsp;Welcome to the vaporware craze.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dozens of individuals
like myself spend
<br>countless hours on the phone hunting down anyone with any kind knowledge
or
<br>contacts to these once unreachable prototypes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many
different systems are
<br>out there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything from the Flagship 1450XLD's to the
1090 5 slot
<br>expansion chassis to the General Computer Corp 7800 keyboard attachment
for the
<br>7800 Pro System.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other extremely rare prototype exist like
the pre-2600
<br>prototypes (only 2 are know to exist with markings such as CX-2000).&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari
<br>5100 (5200jr.), Atari 800XE's, Atari 800XL-F (a 1200XL with a top cartridge
<br>slot), the short release Atari 815 dual drive system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many
prototypes exist
<br>and if your willing to do the digging you can track these rare items
down and
<br>become the proud caretaker of a piece of history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Owning even one small
<br>piece of unreleased hardware, software or even paperwork is an honor
and a
<br>privilege and help to feed a never ending "Atari Fever" which has infected
so
<br>many of us.
<p>&nbsp;With the demise of what was Atari Corp into what is now JTS, one
must wonder
<br>what is in store for us Atari Fanatics for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The future doesn't
<br>look too promising as far as new hardware and software.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is true a few
<br>items will find their way to us here and there, but this unfortunately
wont
<br>last too long and is hurts me deeply to see this happen, to see a legacy
so
<br>magically and majestic and Atari fade away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
is hope though, the
<br>products of the past will help to entertain and entice us for many,
many years
<br>and who knows, perhaps someone out there with the money and spirit
will
<br>purchase the rights to the name Atari and just as the Phoenix, Atari
will rise
<br>once again from the ashes and take flight and bring our own hopes back
up to
<br>look for new wonders to find their way to us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows,
perhaps it will also
<br>bring to us new never released prototypes to hunt down and own as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Happy
<br>hunting and keep the name, keep the legend of Atari strong.
<br>&nbsp;
