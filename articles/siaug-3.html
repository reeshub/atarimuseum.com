<p>Ace of Aces By Accolade
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;Why what on earth is going on at Accolade???&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they
ignoring Electronic
<br>Arts which now owns them and making software for Atari's behind their
back.
<br>Looks like some really smart, sharp, courageous bunch of people are
showing
<br>their stuff, their BEST stuff for Atari 8-bit computers.
<p>&nbsp;I was astounded by this software package, the graphics, sound
and animation
<br>quality are of the HIGHEST QUALITY, the game pits you as a World War
II bomber
<br>pilot over Europe, you have a great number of missions to choose from,
V-2
<br>rockets, prisoner trains, Submarines, bomber to fighter etc... and
you can
<br>practice or go for the real thing.&nbsp; You start off by selecting practice
or
<br>mission, you use your joystick to move the generals arm and pointer
to your
<br>selection on the black board, then you select the type of mission you
will go
<br>on, after that you get an intelligence report on who and what you'll
go
<br>against, after that, you see a full map of the area you will fly over
<br>(Everything is in beautiful detailed, colored graphics with some animation
here
<br>and there) You are then asked if you accept or reject your mission,
if you
<br>reject you go back to the general again, if you accept you have to
load you
<br>bomber, you point to bombs, missiles, fuel and gun rounds, be careful
what you
<br>select, remember this is a simulation, weight is very important!!!&nbsp;
OK, then
<br>-More-
<br>you point to DONE, you see (I think is a very nice touch) an old black
and
<br>white photo album with picture of sirens, people running to plans,
propellers
<br>starting, wheel chocks being pulled and a pilot waving, all at the
same time
<br>you here accompanying sound effects in the background, you then sound
the Ace
<br>of Aces title screen, press the fire button and its off to the simulation,
your
<br>in a real view perspective, everything moves very smoothly, you have gauges and
<br>dials and you see your pilot joystick moving realistically as you control
the
<br>plane, you also have left and right views and bomb bay view for bombing
runs,
<br>all are done in excellent graphics and animation.&nbsp; One note, it
take about a
<br>dozen games before you get used to it, but you can accidentally very
easily
<br>switch views which during fighter to bomber combat can cost you, your
crew and
<br>your plane, but after a few games you get the feel of the game and
learn how to
<br>not make those accidental view changes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The game is very
complex, yet not too
<br>difficult to play, the animation is top quality, it is colorful and
very very
<br>enjoyable to play, the game is a bit pricey: $27.99, but for such a
very high
<br>quality product, its more than worth the price, if you buy the game
and enjoy
<br>it as much I as did and still do, please do yourself and others a favor,
send a
<br>thank letter to Accolade, they deserve it!!!&nbsp; This is the finest
piece of
<br>software I've seen in quite some time.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The Infiltrator By Mindscape
<p>-More-
<br>&nbsp;Mindscape has been a company who has stayed with Atari thru
its long rough
<br>periods and has come out with quite a few nice titles.&nbsp; The Infiltrator
is a
<br>good piece of software.&nbsp; You'll find the accompanying manual to
be a hilarious
<br>addition to the software as it states humorous punch lines such as:&nbsp;
Johnny
<br>"Jimbo-Baby" McGibbits says: "I never go anywhere with my McGibbits
Trim-Fit
<br>bulletproof designer jeans.&nbsp; Timeless style, seamless fit, and
safety from
<br>close range machine gun fire-all at a sensible price."&nbsp;&nbsp;
The manual also
<br>includes an in-depth description of your Wizbang Gizmo DHX-1 Attack
Chopper and
<br>other technical stuff and they call it in the manual.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of
course putting aside
<br>the cute manual and it humor, its the game play that's important, the
graphics
<br>are good, colors are a bit drab, but hey! its an attack helicopter,
not a
<br>BMW!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; The animation is good to fair in most areas, the
sound effects are
<br>good, warning indicators are small, but the audio helps you to spot
and react
<br>well enough to keep yourself from becoming a new SOHO art exhibit in
the middle
<br>of enemy territory.&nbsp; The Status, ADM Tracking and Communication
screens and
<br>excellent and include animation for a top notch effect, overall, this
is a good
<br>game, a little difficult to get the hang of at first, you'll find yourself
<br>seeing the crashed helicopter with your foot sticking out of it screen
for the
<br>first couple of games, but once you get the hang of things, you'll
really like
<br>it and get into it, for $19 this is a game you should look into.
