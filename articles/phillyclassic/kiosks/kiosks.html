<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ultimate addition to
anyone's game room or classic gaming collection....&nbsp; an actual Store
Display Kiosk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Systems such as the Bally
Astrocade, Magnavox Odyssey2, Mattel Intellvision, GCE Vectrex, Coleco
Vision and of course Atari (2600,5200 and many more) all had these wonderous
displays that as kids we used to oggle over and dream of owning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, nows your chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no idea what possessed
me to start these projects other then I thought they'd be a lot of fun
to do and I thought it would be great for people to finally get to relive
the feeling of seeing these tributes to days gone by and to see a proper
setup and presentation of the classic gaming systems we all know and love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have made 3 of these kiosks in time for the Phillyclassic 3 show this
April 26-27, 2002.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hoping to complete several others
and it would be great to see these kiosks "make the rounds" so to speak
and be used at other shows around the country and maybe even overseas,
who knows.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no plans to follow,
no dimensions to reference, no guides or outlines to work by.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Just 3 photo's and the rest was left to some creativity, common sense and
the rest was, well.... just playing it by ear and seeing how things progressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I've photographed the construction of these kiosks each step of the way,
explained my problems, and solutions as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that these
step by step tutorials help others out there who've dreamed of having their
own classic gaming centerpiece, their shrine for their beloved favorite
system.... or if your a real lunatic (like me! :-) then one for all of
your systems (yikes!!!!)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have questions, feel
free to ask. (email me at: <a href="mailto:curt@atarimuseum.com">CURT</a>)&nbsp;
One question I will answer now is: Will you be making these and selling
them?&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I'm only making one of each and I'll be selling them
to those interested.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I make one of each and maybe create
some new ones (I'm thinking about a Coleco Adam center right now) then
thats it, I've had my fun and I'll move on to something new and creative
to occupy my time and to give to the Classic gaming community.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is why the tutorials are available below by clicking on any of the
icons, and you can make your own.&nbsp;&nbsp; Best of luck, take your time
and enjoy! :-)
