<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay then....
lets begin with materials, just as with the Astrocade kiosk, I used a 4'x8'
3/4" sheet of MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard) for $15 a sheet, picked up
4 can of semi-gloss black spray paint and 2 sheets of 2'x4' 1/2 MDF.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Have Home Depot (or Lowes) cut the 3/4" sheet down to 4'x6' and keep the
2'x4' section off to the side as we will be using that later.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now have them cut the 4'x6' sheet into 2 20" x 6' lengths.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Take all of the scraps and head home to start with the additional cutting
work....

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, here's what needs to
be done, if you examine the small photo of the game center you will notice
the side pieces are in two parts, one long upright and a smaller upright
which shapes the control panel area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here's what you'll
do.&nbsp;&nbsp; The monitor depth will be 20" and 22" high, then cut in
3", make a curve and then cut straight down for a 17" depth.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Curve the top rear corner too.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, using a dremel tool
with router attachment and 1/8" router "flute" bit, cut a t-molding line
down the front top portion of the monitor section of the kiosk on both
pieces, then underneath the 3" ledge cut-in, around the curve and then
down 16"&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't need to go all the way down or over the
top and black t-molding doesn't appear to be over the over top of the kiosk
from what I could tell from the photo....
