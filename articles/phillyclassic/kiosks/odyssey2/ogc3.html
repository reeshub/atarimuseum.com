<p><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Now
for the other smaller side panels.&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the photo the kiosk
side panels were in two parts, the larger 6' tall pieces and the smaller
pieces that make up the front and control panel area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Based
on the photo I went with the following dimensions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The depth
would be 7" to add to the larger side panels depth of 17" for a total side
panel depth of 24"&nbsp;&nbsp; The control panel height would be 36", and
would come up 14"&nbsp; (you may want to come out up to 16" for more depth
for your Odyssey2, but I found 14" to work well).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
the control panel front the side pieces would come down 6".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the top of the control panel in the back, the side panel goes up another
1 1/2" higher with a curve, so that piece was 1 1/2" high by 3" deep and
a curve was cut out.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should now have a piece that looks
like this:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Same routine here on both
small side panels, put about 3-4 coats of semi-gloss black onto them, let
sit for a few hours to dry well.&nbsp; Then usings some wide masking tape
I actually covered the whole panels.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare both panels like
this.&nbsp; You'll need a good pen or a Sharpie marker, a t-square or long
flat ruler and a small can or circle guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time to draw
out the racing stripes pattern onto the tape, then onto the next step....
