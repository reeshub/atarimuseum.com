<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the t-molding
cut-outs are done, smooth everything out with a file to clean things up
and time for some paint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spray on a first coating, doesn't
need to be perfect, also spray the front edges of the side panels where
the black t-molding (available from www.happcontrols.com) is going to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wait 15 mins, put a 2nd coat on and repeat for a 3rd coat and if needed,
give it a 4th and final coat, let dry for 1-2 hours in a well ventilated
area.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure to paint the side
panels on the outside facing sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; You wont need to paint
the inside sides of the panels, noone will be seeing them except you when
you install the TV and wire the kiosk up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once
these feel dry enough, put them off to the side and let them sit a good
full day or so to allow the paint to dry thoroughly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The side
panels will be getting additional custom racing stripes down the sides
later on.... you'll need yellow, red and blue spray paint.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also you'll need some masking tape, an exacto knife and some newspaper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A yard stick or straight edged object will also be needed for setting up
the lines for masking the surface later on when we paint the striping on
the sides.....
