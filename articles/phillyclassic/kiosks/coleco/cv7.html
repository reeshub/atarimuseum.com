<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The underside of the plywood
will look like this once you screw in both pieces of 3/4" plywood to act
as the mounting ledges for the joystick base.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put
the joystick into place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mount it permanently to the 3/4" plywood
underneath each of its sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the backs of the joysticks
is a retaining ring, using a flat screw driver gently remove it and the
centering collar and place them off to the side.&nbsp;&nbsp; Slide the
joystick out from the base, repeat on the other side.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be mounting laminate
over the whole plywood sheet so you'll need the stalk from the joystick
out of the base for a flush surface, this is also why the fire buttons
are not secured until later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now onto the pedestal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Back to the tablesaw for some more 10 degree cuts for the 2 side pieces
and cutting the front piece to proper height with a 10 degree cut on one
side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First I need a break from all the wood work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The doorbell rang earlier and the graphics I ordered just arrived, so I
decided to mount the side panel graphics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used
some images supplied to me by a friend and then cleaning them up and sharpening
the edges I created some Adobe Encapsulated Post Script (.EPS) format files
(ranging from 5mb to 30mb) and sent them to a graphics design house for
professional quality decals to be made.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can go any route
you want from doing these on an inkjet printer to Kinko's (waaaaayyyy tooo
expensive from them and quality is not what I was shooting for) to a graphics
company.&nbsp;&nbsp; I choose the later since I wanted this done properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still waiting for the custom acrylic header to arrive and also the huge
package with classic gaming posters I had made up too....&nbsp;&nbsp; okay
back to work!

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
pedestal....&nbsp;&nbsp; the side pieces are cut and checked for fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now using a 1/8" drill bit, drill into the sides for some screws.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do this step!&nbsp;&nbsp; The wood is a lot smaller and could split if
you run a screw straight into the wood without a guide hole to go into.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dab some glue onto the connecting sides and screw them together.
