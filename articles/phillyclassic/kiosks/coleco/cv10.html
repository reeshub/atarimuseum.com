<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All righty then....&nbsp;&nbsp;
for the black controller area laminate I took some spare 1x6 lying around
and cut it 1 ft long, this would be my template for cutting a piece of
the black laminate for two control area pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp; After which
I'll file the edges with nice round corners for a more finished look and
glue that down later....&nbsp;&nbsp; Why so long?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, as
they say "size matters" :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; errrr, ahem....&nbsp;
okay, the reason is that what your not seeing is a spot on the other side
of the joystick area for a future keypad to be installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What I'd like to use are a pair of Champ Keypads, tough to find, so for
now the spots will stay vacant until a pair of the buggers shows up or
an alternative is found.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone with some good ideas that look
along the lines of the OEM coleco controllers, send me a mail to: <a href="mailto:curt@atarimuseum.com">The
Kiosk Lunatic</a> (aka... me :-)

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, while I let the laminate
cure on the pedestal assembly, lets get to work on some of the hardware
and get started on putting this beastie together so its not just a collection
of parts laying around my basement pissing my wife off cause she can't
get into the laundry room (As she likes to say "Get your Atari game-thingie
kiosk outta my way or I'll make laundry tables out of it all!!!"&nbsp;&nbsp;
{Fortunately, she says it with a smile, so I know she wouldn't do that....
I hope}

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets start at the base and
work our way up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Line up the bottom base to and place the side
panels onto the floor backside on the floor, using a 1/2" drill bit I went
through the side panel and into the 2x4 of the base.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This will be for the bolt to pass through.&nbsp;&nbsp; A company called
HM sells assembly products.&nbsp; In the Nuts/Bolts/Hardware aisle of Home
Depot you will find an assortment of cabinet assembly products, among them
are the HM line of pieces.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
the inside of the base fine where the 1/2" drill came through.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Using a 5/8" speed bit, drill out the 1/2" hole and go in about 3/4" depth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What your doing is making a counter-sink hole for another piece of HM hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I suggest using this hardware, we are talking about a big piece of furniture
here once assembled, its heavy and you want it to be durable, so don't
take the easy route and just screw in 3" screws or something else, this
will NOT give you the strength your project needs and will end up causing
you grief later on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use this assembly hardware, you'll thank
yourself later for taking the few extra minutes.
