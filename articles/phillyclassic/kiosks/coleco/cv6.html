<p><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Before
proceeding further, lets discuss a few things about the Colecovision kiosk
control panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First thing that I notice is that the
control panel appears to be made out of a formed plastic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most of us do not have access to having such a panel made without high
costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is someone out there who owns a bodyshop or
a friend who owns one, you may try your hand at making the control panel
out of fiberglass.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, most of us mere mortals will do
just fine with wood with laminate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing
about the control panel is it appears to have some pockets above the joystick/fire
buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to omit this for now, maybe I'll add it
in later, but its more for holding brochures.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be good
for holding cartridges perhaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to leave that
out for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the Colecovision control panel is
biased.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its for righties and is not very PC, so I've
changed the orientation of the joystick/firebuttons on the right side to
be more friendly to lefties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can arrange them anyway
you want, if you want to stay true the the original, go for it, it not,
not problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I personally would love to do a revision
2.0 control panel later on and add a bump-out in the center of the control
panel and mount a Roller Controller flush to really give it a more complete
playable look &amp; feel.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next step.... drill out the
holes for the fire buttons and the 4 corners of where the joystick controller
will be mounted inside of.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll use the router to cut
out the remaining wood for the opening.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you may be asking,
whats with the big square hole?&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not just a hole for the
joystick to stick up out of???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stalk on the joystick
is short, and mounting underneath the plywood will shorten it way too much
and you end up with a true Colecovision controller effect.... too damned
stubby for any real use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I've cut out holes for the
whole joystick assembly to sit flush with the plywood and I'll mount wood
underneath for the joystick base to screw into.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The holes are all drilled
and routed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time to mount the front 2x4 onto the underside
front of the plywood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When putting in the screws,
screw them flush the the plywood, not straight down, otherwise they may
not sit flush and you'll have to redo them.

<p><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Take
some of the spare 3/4" plywood, cut a section about 2" wide and 2 feet
long and then cut them into 4 2" x 6" pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These will
be the mounting ledges for the joystick controllers to screw into.&nbsp;
Place the joystick base into position, then on the back of the plywood
place each piece on each side of the joystick base, then mark them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now flip the plywood back over, holding the 3/4" plywood ledge against
the backside marking, now mark the front on each side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Put some wood glue onto each piece and them screw them to the plywood from
the top around the joystick base opening.&nbsp;&nbsp; Test to make sure
the base fits, then repeat on the other side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One piece of 3/4" plywood will overlap underneath one of the firebutton
openings.... no worry, just cut the needed amount out with a drill or router
so that the firebutton screw-on nut will clear it and screw tightly to
the back of the 1/4" plywood (don't screw the firebuttons into place yet,
just test for fit.)
