<font size=+2>Reproducing a Classic
Gaming Kiosk (Part 13)</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
guess 13 truly is an unlucky number.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulled a bunch of
images from my camera to continue making another page or two more tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unfortunately it looks as if 3 or 4 photo's have been lost, so I'm going
to have to talk through the instructions with no photo's to go by to get
everyone up to the point where I can continue the photo's again.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
work has long since been done, so its difficult to go back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, back to work....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time for the TV shelf.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Take a piece of the 12" x 48" black shelving and using whats left of the
8' 2x4s cut a piece 48" long and two pieces 6" long.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Drilling 4 holes evenly spaced out along the 48" side of the shelf.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now dab some glue onto the top of the 2x4 and screw several 3" screws into
the 2x4 through the holes on the shelf.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drill 2 more
holes onto the ends of the shelf and dab some glue onto the 6" pieces and
then screw them onto the shelf as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sort
of looks very similar to the base of the kiosk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The long 2x4 is for strength and the side pieces will be connected to the
side panels of the kiosk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some additional strength,
screw a final screw from the ends of the 48" 2x4 into the side 6" 2x4's.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeating
the same process of drilling out holes, counter-sinking and screwing in
the bolts, mount the TV shelf so that it sits 3" higher then the top back
edge of the control panel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry that the 2x4's are not
painted black.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These will not be seen as the 24" x 48"
piece of the plexiglass is going to be placed in front of the TV shelf.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You
may be out of 2x4's by now (I have a large pile as I'm also finishing my
basement in the house) so if you need more, pick up another piece as we
are going to need at least one more 8' piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Take a piece of 2x4 thats at least 20" long.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Using your tablesaw cut two lengths that are 1"-1 1/2" thick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Line this up at the front edge of the TV shelf and screw them vertically
into the inside of the side panels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the vertical
supports and screw-in posts for the plexiglass when we mount it.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now
onto the plexiglass....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will need to decide what
size TV you'll be using.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 20" TV is about as big as you want
to go.&nbsp; 27" will be too big unless you want to do away with the vinyl
lettering across the top of the display on the plexiglass "The Arcade Quality
Video Game System"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This really adds to the look
and I personally would recommend its inclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also
remember something, your not sitting 10-15 feet from the TV screen, you
are standing in front of the kiosk just like you would be in front of an
arcade game.&nbsp;&nbsp; 19" or 20" TV's will definitely do the trick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So,&nbsp; choose your TV, if you've got one, great!&nbsp;&nbsp; If you
need to pick up one up just to dedicate to the kiosk, go to Best Buy, Ames,
Circuit City or any place you frequent for your Audio/Video needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
(I'd avoid Radio Shack, their TV prices are ridiculously high)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I picked up a nice 20" TV for $129 from Ames.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take
your measurements of the TV screen width and its starting height from the
bottom and its top height.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add 3" to the bottom
height since 3" of the plexiglass will be blocking the TV shelf.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now add the bottom height to that from the TV and then the top height.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, take your measurements and lets go to the plexiglass.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When picking up a sheet, find one that has the protective coating that
is smooth and tight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some sheets have protective coating that
may be wrinkled, avoid those, we need a flat smooth protective coating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Using your measurements, draw out the box in the center of the plexiglass
onto the protective coating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using an exacto blade, cut out
the tracing and then peel away all of the surrounding protective cover
leaving a box in the center.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will be where the TV will
display through the plexiglass.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick up a can of
black spray paint and spray a coating onto the plexiglass, wait 15 mins
and repeat 2-3 more times to make sure you have a thick and completely
covered surface.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You
can check by lifting the plexiglass up and peel back a section of the protective
coating on the otherside of the plexiglass and see if its a solid black
surface.&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, shoot another coat or two to make sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let dry for 30-45 mins and then peel off the whole protective coating on
the otherside and then on the painted side, using the exacto blade pick
a corner of the coating up enough to grab with your fingers, then peel
it off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While you've got that can of spray paint handy,
lets also take care of one other thing....
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
the display case your height should be around 30 1/2" high, so you can
pick up two sheets of 30"x32" plexiglass and also pick up a sliding door
guide kit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cut the sliding door rails to 48" long and
paint them black as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While at Home Depot
(or Lowes) also pick up a plexiglass scoring tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
plexiglass sliding doors will need to be cut down to 30 3/8" high by 26"
wide (we want a little overlap) and using a file, smooth out the edges
and round out the corners a bit too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then at 15" high
cut out a 1" hole on each plexiglass door for finger holes to slide the
doors, sand them too so they are smooth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Okay, almost there, lets mount the plexiglass display, line up the TV for
a check, then rub on the vinyl lettering above the display openeing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then its time to drill some holes for cabling and time to wire up those
controls.
