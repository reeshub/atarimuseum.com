<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets talk about what materials
to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously on the first kiosk project.... the
Colecovision kiosk I went the route of using particle board and then covering
the outside wall with black laminate and spraying the inside wall with
black spray paint.&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect was very good, but the expensive
was a bit high and the time involved was lengthy.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I thought
about alternatives when right in front of me in my basement was the very
answer!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just recently had a new house built and
the builder had left some materials for the custom kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One the materials was a 4' x 12' sheet of MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard)
this stuff is gorgeous to say the least (in a wood working sense that is
:-)

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I ran down to the local
Home Depot to check costs and to see if this would be something economical
that everyone might be able to use before recommending it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So while a sheet of 4x8 particle board runs $14, Medium Density Fiberboard
is $15 so this is definitely the route to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why am I so psych'ed
up over this stuff???&nbsp;&nbsp; Go check it out, its as smooth as glass,
strong and easy to work with.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the
plan here is, I used the MDF and instead of laminate or contact paper,
we'll use Black semi-gloss spray paint for the coating.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So lets talk dimensions....
going back to the first project, the Coleco Kiosk I mentioned that in order
to make life easier, lets use divisions of 4x8 sheets of material.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So get your local Home Depot of Lowes to cut your MDF down to 4 X 6, keep
that 2x4 sheet for later as we'll have use for it.... now have them cut
the 4x6 down into 2 2x6 sheets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next,
looking at the photo I took some guesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 Degree angles
looked best suited for the cut out and top angle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So
cut the top down at the 10 degree angle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Come down 7" and then
cut in at another 10 degree angle inward 6" then down 24" and back out
at 10 degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used a small can to mark out the rounded corners
and used a router to make my cut-outs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did some wood
putty touchups where the router got a little out of control, let sit for
2 hours and then sanded and filed everything down....
