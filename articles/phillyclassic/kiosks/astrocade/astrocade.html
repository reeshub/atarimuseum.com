<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While
preparing for the upcoming Phillyclassic show this coming April 26-27 (<a href="http://www.phillyclassic.com">www.phillyclassic.com</a>)
I thought it would be nice to expand upon the large Atari-centric kiosks
which would already be coming to the show for people to play and enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Kiosks have a certain alure to them, they bring back fond childhood memories
of going to the videogame store each weekend to marvel at the kiosks and
the treasures inside, to play the latest game releases and to meet up with
your friends for some friendly competition until owner got tired of you
hogging up the display and kicked you out, only to come back again another
day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so above is our reference
picture to go by.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years back the webmaster
of the Bally Shrine (Charles Taylor) had a few of these beauties for sale
and they were brand new still sealed in the boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, a
few lucky people got to buy one from him, the rest unfortunately headed
to the trash containers.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Charles, he couldn't
keep them any longer and had to dispose of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That
is a a true shame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, lets see about doing the old
Astrocade justice and building a suitable home for such a cool system....
