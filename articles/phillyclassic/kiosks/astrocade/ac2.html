<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a test run of spray
paint on one side of the kiosk side panel before cutting it to see how
much paint and how many coatings it would take to get a nice finish and
also to see if it would hold up and not chip or scratch off easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well the paint certainly passed the test well, so this is the definite
route to take for our coating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next thing to do
once the side panel is sanded and in a finished shape is to lay down the
uncut panel, place the finished panel onto of it and trace the needed outlines
to cut the other panel.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take
the cut out sections from the side panels and lets put them to some good
use.&nbsp;&nbsp; These will become the side panels for the control area.&nbsp;&nbsp;
After looking at the photo, measuring the Astrocade (10.5" depth roughly)&nbsp;&nbsp;
I went with a 14" depth and a 2" front panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cut
two "wedges" at a 10" angle with a front side 2" high then 10 degree upward
for a top side of 14" long.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Referring
back to the Coleco Kiosk work, I used a router kit on my Craftsman Dremel
tool and using a 1/8th inch router bit centered on the edge of the side
panel and then 2 "wedges" I ran it down them and routed out the opening
where the chrome T-Molding (Available from Happ Controls: www.happcontrols.com)&nbsp;&nbsp;
.Take your first finished panel some place well ventilated and lets shoot
a few coats of paint onto it and get it started.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I sprayed the two "wedges" first, then proceeded to spraying the side panel.

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spray
on the coatings as follows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Spray down one full coating just
to cover the entire side panels, doesn't have to be perfect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wait 15 mins, then spray on a 2nd more even coating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Again, wait another 15-20 mins and apply a 3rd and final even coating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wait about 1 to 1 1/2 hours for a good dry surface, flip and repeat on
the inside of the panel.&nbsp;&nbsp; I only applied 2 coats on the inside
panel as its not going to be as visible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Give the front edges
a light coating as well where the t-molding will be going, this way is
has a clean, even look.
