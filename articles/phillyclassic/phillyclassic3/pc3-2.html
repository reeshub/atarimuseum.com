<p>Demo's, displays and so much more.... with over 3 dozen vendors and
exhibitors everyone had something
<br>to play, try out, buy and trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attendee's
ranged from the 30+ crowd to many young kids who
<br>seemed equally biten by the Classic Gaming excitement.

<br>My main man Cassidy and his gorgeous Nutting Associated 2 player Computer
Space.... he looks like
<br>a proud father and his first born! :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassidy had
for sale the rare unreleased Atari Polo game
<br>&nbsp;by Carol Shaw.... he had them done up in great looking reproduction
boxes.

<p>The 22' wide aisles provided plenty of room for attendee's to stop and
gather aound the tables on both
<br>sides and allow plenty of free movement for people walking from one
side of the floor to another, this
<br>was a pleasant feature with 1,000 attendee's filling the show floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A HUGE plus over last years
<br>show which was 1/6th the size of this years show and was jammed to
the gills with its 400 attendees!

<br>This joystick definitely earned its name, it was very Slik indeed!&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everything a gamer could want to play
<br>PC games.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is rather huge though, so make sure you've
got a dedicated space for this beautiful beastie.
