<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
April 7, 1982 the first draft of the Atari Sweet 16 Home Computer Product
Specifications were written.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several revisions were made up
until June 11, 1982.&nbsp;&nbsp; The specifications outlined the designs
for a new pair of computer systems which would replace the overpriced Atari
400 and 800 systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; These new systems would come in 2 different
memory configurations: 16K and 64K.&nbsp;&nbsp; They would come in sleek
low profile one piece cases with 4 function keys, a built-in HELP key,
International character set, an on-board diagnostic system.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The systems would come with a new set of 2 enhanced SIO connectors which
would use standard DB-15 connectors, and a new expansion bus connector
system called the PBI (Parallel Bus Interface) which would be an 8-bit
gateway into each of the custom chips contained within the new systems.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This new bus would soon be accompanied by an expansion box system called
the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/1090xl.html">Atari 1090:&nbsp;
XL Expansion System </a>which would have given the new 1000 series computers
5 expansion slots.&nbsp; (Although the earlier specifications of the XL
Expansion System listed it as having up to 8 slots.)</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These new
systems where designated:&nbsp; The Atari 1000 and the Atari 1000-X.&nbsp;
The 1000 would have 16K memory and the 1000-X would have 64K of memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Have you ever wondered why when the Atari 1200XL was introduced, that all
its peripherals were not numbered after it, like the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/1050/1050.html">Atari
1050</a> disk drive should have been the Atari 1250, not the 1050.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or the Atari 1010 cassette recorder should have been the Atari 1210 or
the Atari 1025 dot matrix printer should have been the Atari 1225.&nbsp;&nbsp;
These peripherals were designed for the new Atari 1000 line and had the
10xx designations.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So where
does the Atari 1200XL fit in???</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari
1200XL was Atari's final design revision for the Sweet 16 line of computers,
actually it was first called just the Atari 1200, there was no XL.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was decided that since the system had new features it should have (XL:
Extended Line).&nbsp;&nbsp; However the 1200XL was stripped of its major
"HIGH END" features outlined in the SWEET 16 designs and was left crippled
by management.&nbsp; (Technie's who have worked on the 1200XL should note
all the unnecessary added video circuitry in the 1200XL which didn't improve
the video quality over the 800, but actually made it worse).&nbsp;&nbsp;
The idea around the "revised" version of the 1000 Series which became the
1200XL was that Atari Home Computer management felt that the computers
should be more like consumer products and less like a hobbyist product,
so the idea of expansion bus connections, enhanced Serial I/O (SIO) ports
and built-in BASIC were all dropped in favor of a simple, closed box.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What in turn happened was the original Sweet 16 spec's did eventually surface:&nbsp;
as the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/600/600xl.html">Atari 600XL</a>
and 800XL computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the 1200XL failed, Atari's computer
division management quickly had engineering come up with systems closer
to the original Sweet-16 specifications.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, to keep costs
down, the Sweet 16's were placed into cheaper smaller cases with low quality
keyboards, the function keys were removed and the only one SIO port was
installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The true Sweet 16's never made it to market.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The only model Atari computer that comes close to fulfilling the original
1982 dream of the Sweet 16 specifications was the unreleased <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/1400.html">Atari
1400XL</a>.</font>
