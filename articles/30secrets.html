<p>In its 11-year history, Atari has become one of the biggest, flashiest,
most
<br>influential companies in history.&nbsp; The have had their share of
incredible
<br>successes and embarassing faliures.&nbsp; Perhaps more than anything
else, the have
<br>had their secrets.
<p>
<br>Atari is very tight-lipped.&nbsp; At one point, employees were asked
to sign
<br>confidentiality agreements and had to use magnetic ID carts to walk
through the
<br>company corridors.&nbsp; Aside from the actual cartridges, the public
learns little
<br>about Atari's games and the people who create them.
<p>
<br>Until now.&nbsp; We have interviewed dozens of employees of the company,
past and
<br>present.&nbsp; We have guaranteed them complete anonymity in exchange
for a tip, an
<br>insight, a never-before-heard anecdote.&nbsp; From the interviews we
have complied
<br>the following secrets of Atari, which are published here for the first
time.
<p><img SRC="homepong.jpg" height=333 width=500>
<p>
<br>&nbsp;Pong comes home
<br>1)&nbsp; Nolan Bushnell, Atari's founding father, originally named
the company
<br>Syzygy (the sun, moon and earth in total eclipse)
<p>2) Bushnell is generally believed to be the author of PONG, Atari's
first game.
<br>Actually, Magnavox released the ODYSSEY 100, the first home video game
system,
<br>which included a game remarkably similar to PONG, several months before
PONG's
<br>debut in the arcades in 1972.&nbsp; Years later Bushnell admitted in
court that
<br>he had seen an Odyssey prototype on display earlier in 1972.&nbsp;
The Odyssey 100
<br>was invented by Ralph Baer.
<p><img SRC="pong-protofront.jpg" height=294 width=314>
<p>
<br>3) Bally/Midway rejected Bushnell's PONG when he demonstrated the game
in its
<br>Chicago offices in 1972.&nbsp; Bushnell went back to California and
started Atari.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4) Given a choice between MAPPY and POLE POSITION, two arcade creations
by
<br>the Japanese firm NAMCO, Bally/Midway amazingly opted for MAPPY.&nbsp;
Atari had to
<br>settle for POLE POSITION, which went on to become the biggest game
of 1983.
<p>5) GRAVITAR was one of Atari's worst-selling arcade games.&nbsp; So
they took the
<br>game program out of the cabinets and converted them all into BLACK
WIDOW.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="Swarcade.JPG" height=412 width=291>
<p>
<br>6) MIKE HALLY designed GRAVITAR.&nbsp; He recently redeemed himself
as the project
<br>leader for Atari's spectacular STAR WARS game.
<p>7)&nbsp; RICK MAUER never programmed another game for Atari after he
did SPACE
<br>INVADERS for the VCS.&nbsp; He is said to have earned only $11,000
for a cartridge
<br>the grossed more than $100 million.
<p>8)&nbsp; TODD FRY, on the other hand, has collected close to $1 million
in royalties
<br>for this widely criticized VCS PAC-MAN.
<p>9)&nbsp; The man responsible for bringing PAC-MAN to Atari - JOE ROBBINS,
former
<br>president of coin-op - was severly reprimanded by chairman of the board
RAY
<br>KASSAR for making the deal with Namco without consulting him.&nbsp;
It seems
<br>Robbins was in Japan negotiating a legal matter with Namco at the time,
and
<br>Namco apparently demanded that Atari buy the home rights to PAC-MAN
as part
<br>of the settlement.&nbsp; PAC-MAN had yet to take off, but when it did,
Robbins'
<br>gutsy decision paid off as PAC-MAN went on to become the company's
best-selling
<br>cartridge ever.
<p>E.T.
<br>10) The man responsible for bringing E.T. to Atari?&nbsp; None other
that Warner
<br>Communications' chairman STEVE ROSS.&nbsp; So convinced was he that
E.T. possesed
<br>video game star quality, Ross paid Steven Spielberg an enormous sum
(did I
<br>hear $21 million?) for the rights the the little extraterrestrial bugger.
<p>Designer HOWIE WARSHAW spun the game out in four months, only three
million
<br>cartridges were sold and Atari soon began accouncing million dollar
losses.
<br>E.T. is now selling for as little as $5 in some stores.
<p><img SRC="Hsw.jpg" height=112 width=250>
<br>Howard Warshaw
<br>11) WARSHAW also designed the RAIDERS of the LOST ARK cartridge and
YAR'S
<br>REVENGE. which started out as a licensed version of the arcade game,
STAR
<br>CASTLE.&nbsp; "YAR" is "RAY" KASSAR backwards.
<p><img SRC="TANK.JPG" height=259 width=343>
<p>
<br>12) One of Atari's most popular early arcade games was TANK, only it
didn't say
<br>Atari anywhere on the cabinet or screen.&nbsp; Instead, it said "KEE
GAMES", which
<br>was another name for Atari from 1973-78.&nbsp; Atari and Kee (named
after JOE
<br>KEENAN, Bushnell's longtime partner) put out identical games in order
to create
<br>more business for Atari.&nbsp; For instance, SPIKE (Kee) and REBOUND
(Atari) were
<br>volleyball games that came out a month apart in 1974.
<p><img SRC="ATARITEL.JPG" height=260 width=271>
<p>
<br>13) TANK was designed by STEVE BRISTOW, who is still with the company
after
<br>all these years.&nbsp; Most recently he has been in charge of Ataritel,
Atari's
<br>telecommunications project which had been codenamed, "Falcon."
<p>14) Code-names have always been popular at Atari.&nbsp; The VCS was
"Stella," the
<br>400 computer was "Candy," the 800 was "Coleen, the 5200 was "Pam."&nbsp;
All were
<br>named after well endowed female employees working at Atari (except
for Stella,
<br>which was a bicycle trade name).
<p>15) And then there was "Sylvia," the 5200 that never was.&nbsp; Pam,
as everyone by
<br>now knows, was a stripped down 400 computer for the sole purpose of
game
<br>playing.&nbsp; Sylvia was intended to be Atari's answer to Intellivision
and was in
<br>the works long before Pam was born.&nbsp; But problems developed largely
because
<br>the 5200 was projected to be compatible with VCS software, which limited
the
<br>design of the new hardware.&nbsp; When push finally came to shove,
Sylvia went out
<br>the window and Pam walked in the door.
<p>16) COSMOS, Atari's experiment with holography, was a battery-operated
game
<br>system that was introduced at a New York press conference in the spring
of
<br>1980.&nbsp; Created by AL ALCORN, COSMOS was never to be seen again.
<p><img SRC="ALCORN-1.JPG" height=194 width=262>
<p>
<br>17) Alcorn was the first engineer hired by Nolan Bushnell.&nbsp; His
first project
<br>was PONG.&nbsp; His second project was SPACE RACE, the forerunner to
FROGGER.
<p><img SRC="2700.JPG" height=228 width=400>
<p>
<br>18) Another project announced was a remote-control VCS.&nbsp; Since
it was
<br>wireless, you could play games at 30 feet without having to hassle
with the
<br>console.&nbsp; It too mysteriously disappeared from Atari's catalogue.
(Note: it
<br>looked almost exactly like the Atari 5200)
<p>
<br><img SRC="DIGDUG.JPG" height=262 width=200>
<p>
<br>19) Nobody in Atari coin-op liked DIG DUG, the company's first Japanese
<br>import, except for BRIAN MCGHIE, now with STARPATH.&nbsp; It was McGhie
who
<br>added the finishing touches to DIG DUG.&nbsp; His latest game is RABBIT
TRANSIT.
<p>20) QUANTUM and FOOD FIGHT were not designed by Atari.&nbsp; They were
the work of
<br>GENERAL COMPUTER CORP. of Cambridge, Massachusetts.&nbsp; GCC broke
into the
<br>business selling kits that would speed-up MISSILE COMMAND.&nbsp; Atari
sued and
<br>settled with GCC for the above-mentioned games.
<p>
<br><img SRC="TEMPEST.JPG" height=222 width=169>
<p>
<br>21) TEMPEST was originally intended to be a first-person SPACE INVADERS
type
<br>game.&nbsp; Then DAVE THEURER came up with the idea for tubes on the
screen.
<br>THEURER also designed MISSILE COMMAND.
<p>
<br><img SRC="asteroids.JPG" height=221 width=168>
<p>
<br>22) The first 200 ASTEROID machines were actually LUNAR LANDERS.&nbsp;
Atari was so
<br>hot on ASTEROIDS that it cut short the production run on LUNAR LANDER
-
<br>Atari's first vector game - and released the 200 complete with LUNAR
LANDER
<br>cabinet art.
<p>
<br>23) ASTEROIDS had two incarnations before it achieved its spectacular
success.
<br>The first, PLANET GRAB, simply required you to claim planets by touching
them
<br>with your spaceship.&nbsp; The second version, COSMOS, allowed you
to blow up the
<br>planets, and duel with another ship, SPACE WARS-style.&nbsp; Only in
ASTEROIDS,
<br>which came along two years later, did Atari engineer LYLE RAINS introduce
the
<br>concept of floating rocks.
<p>24) Many at Atari, past and present, dispute Rains' claim that he was
solely
<br>responsible for ASTEROIDS.&nbsp; ED LOGG, who programmed it and who
also had his
<br>hand in the design of CENTIPEDE and MILLIPEDE, is said to be the true
<br>mastermind behind ASTEROIDS.
<p>25) One of ED LOGG's games that has never been released in the arcades
is
<br>called MAZE INVADERS.
<p>
<br><img SRC="battlezone.JPG" height=227 width=170>
<p>
<br>26) BATTLEZONE programmer ED ROTBERG left Atari after he was forced
to convert
<br>his favorite fame to Army specifications.&nbsp; Dubbed the MK-60 by
the Army, it
<br>included 30 game variations, improved steering and magnification, and
<br>simulations of Russian and American tanks.&nbsp; It sold for $30,000.
<p>27) Rotberg joined two other Atari engineers, HOWARD DELMAN and ROGER
HECTOR,
<br>and formed VIDEA, which not too long ago was bought by Nolan Bushnell
for more
<br>than $1 million and renamed SENTE TECHNOLOGIES.
<p>
<br><img SRC="BREAKOUT.JPG" height=218 width=290>
<p>
<br>28) President of Apple Computers STEVE JOBS began his high-tech career
at
<br>Atari.&nbsp; He was known to walk around barefoot, kick up his dirty
deet on
<br>executives' desks, and talk continuously about going to India to met
a guru.
<br>Not only did he do the latter, he desigened BREAKOUT before leaving
Atari for
<br>good.
<p>
<br><img SRC="AVALANCH.JPG" height=261 width=137>
<p>
<br>29) Before they left, designers AL MILLER, DAVID CRANE, LARRY KAPLAN
and BOB
<br>WHITEHEAD were working on the games that would later become Activision
<br>cartridges.&nbsp; Crane's DRAGSTER was a spin-off of the Atari coin-op
DRAG RACE and
<br>Kaplan's KABOOM was based on the Atari coin-op AVALANCHE.
<p>30) WARREN ROBINETT, tired of Atari's policy of no author credit for
game
<br>designers, decided to sign his game, ADVENTURE, in an obscure secret
room in
<br>the program.&nbsp; He never even told his fellow designers about this
for the fear
<br>of work getting out and he being reprimanded.&nbsp; Ultimately, a 12-year-old
boy
<br>in Salt Lake City discovered the secret room when it wad written: "Created
by
<br>Warren Robinett."&nbsp; To his surprise, Robinett was never punished.&nbsp;
He too left
<br>Atari shortly thereafter.
