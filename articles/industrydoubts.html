<P><IMG SRC="Jtrameil.JPG" HEIGHT=297 WIDTH=325 ALIGN=LEFT>ATLANTA, May
8th, --&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari Corporation made an unexpected appearance at
the Comdex personal computer trade show here to convince a skeptical industry
that the company was viable and that its new products would soon come to
market.

<P>But after two days of statements that seemed contradictory, vague promises
about the future of a new computer and sketchy descriptions of future models,
there seemed to be more doubters than ever.

<P>"We've seen marketing strategies changed before our eyes," said Barbam
Isgur, an analyst and consultant who follows the consumer electronics industry,
as she emerged from an Atari meeting.

<P>Others expressed amazement that Jack Tramiel, Atari’s tough-acting and
unpredictable owner, was still the center of industry attention, even while
his products and his company faced an uncertain fate.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Ousted From Commodore</FONT></B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tramiel bought the company
from Warner Communications Inc. last year, after he was ousted as chief
executive of Commodore International Ltd., Atari’s archrival.&nbsp; The
deal involved no cash, and gave Warner a 32 percent stake in the company.&nbsp;
The company bears little resemblance to its old self.&nbsp; Mr. Tramiel
has replaced all of the executives and is rapidly replacing the product
line.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everywhere that Mr. Tramiel
went in the sprawling Georgia World Congress Center, where the Comdex show
was held, he seemed to leave a trail of confusion.&nbsp; Most of it concerned
an innovative, new home computer, called the Atari 520ST.&nbsp; Like Commodore's
forthcoming Amiga computer - which was shown only to a select few in a
hotel room near the conference --- the Atari machine sports the fancy graphics
and easy-to use features of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh.&nbsp; Both
will sell for about a third of the Macintosh's price.

<P>The Atari computer's graphics are stunning, and unlike the Macintosh,
it works in color.&nbsp; Many in the decimated home computer and software
industry are rooting for Atari, hoping it will make consumers excited about
computers once again.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Atari's first promise
is already going sour.&nbsp; Early in the year, Mr. Tramiel said shipment
of the 520SL would begin by April - a statement Atari now denies was made
- but at Comdex the shipping date became July.&nbsp; With July two months
away, it was still not clear where those shipments would be headed. . In
January, when he first showed the computer, Mr. Tramiel said the 520SL
would be sold in the same manner as previous Atari and Commodore home machines:
through mass marketers such as K Mart and Toys "R" Us.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Plan Is Changed</FONT></B>

<P>But by last Monday, the plan had suddenly changed.&nbsp; Mr. Tramiel
said the machine was too complex for un-trained salesmen and competed with
far more expensive models, so it would be sold through computer specialty
stores, alongside IBM PC's and Apples.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a news conference on Tuesday,
he changed the plan again.&nbsp; The sophisticated version would be sold
in specialty stores, and a stripped-down, less-powerful model, the 520ST,
never before publicly mentioned would be on mass-marketers' shelves by
August.&nbsp; "The press seems to have trouble getting this right," Mr.
Tramiel said.

<P>When Atari officials were asked at the news conference to list the computer
dealers that would be handling the 520ST when volume shipments begin in
July, they could not name one.

<P>As a result, few in the industry believe they will ever see production
models of the 520ST.&nbsp; And those who do, doubt that it will happen
any time soon.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer specialty stores
have been shy of Mr. Tramiel since his Commodore days, when he first sold
his inexpensive computers through them, then abruptly provided the products
to discounters.&nbsp; That left the specialty stores with large inventories
of overpriced machines, and few warm feelings for Mr. Tramiel.&nbsp; In
the absence of many other computers to offer home users, however, especially
after the demise of IBM’s PCjr, retailers may have no choice but to deal
with Mr. Tramiel.

<P>"IBM and Apple are really not treating the low end of the market right,"
said William E. Ladin Jr., chairman of Computer craft, a chain of 61 computer
stores in the Southwest.&nbsp; "Jack Tramiel has the right idea.&nbsp;
I'd like to see it all work out.&nbsp; "

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Mr. Ladin, however,
worries whether it is worth the effort to sell an $800 machine.&nbsp; "It
took far more hand holding and explaining to sell a PCjr to a first-time
customer for $800 than to sell a $5000 PC-AT to a veteran," Mr. Ladin said,
recalling IBM’s Christmas promotion of the PCjr.&nbsp; "We sold a bunch,
but my salesmen hated me."

<P>Software is another problem for Atari.&nbsp; While the new Atari machine
is similar to the Macintosh, it uses an entirely different operating system,
called Gem, that was designed by Digital Research Inc.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari officials assert that
more than 100 software titles will be available for the machine, most written
by small software houses that desperately need work.&nbsp; At the show
on Monday, Sigmund Hartmann, a former Commodore executive brought in by
Mr. Tramiel to head the software effort, also hinted that the prestigious
Microsoft International Inc. might be preparing a program or two for the
Atari machine.&nbsp; "We're shipping them a machine and they're real interested,"
he said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But on Tuesday, Microsoft's
chairman, William Gates, said, "At this point, we have no plans for the
Atari machine, nothing under development".&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari's future may
be ultimately determined by its finances, not its new products.&nbsp; The
company's financial situation is poor, because sales of Atari's old line
are "very, very slow," Mr. Tramiel said, in part because of continuing
legal&nbsp; wrangles with Warner and Commodore.&nbsp; A lack of funds could
slow development of two other long-promised Atari products: a 32-bit computer
for business use, which the company has yet to show, and a $500 compact
disk reader - similar to those used for high-quality music recordings -
that, can store vast amounts of information.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We'll have them by fall,"
Mr. Tramiel said, adding that the compact disk drive would make it possible
to put encyclopedias, legal casebooks and patents in electronic form, all
available to consumers for a relatively low price.&nbsp; "My slogan is
the best value and the highest technology, and that is what I will deliver."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tramiel is a tough competitor,
and while he rarely delivers all that he promises, he has always delivered
something.&nbsp; Not everyone is willing to write him off.
<BR>"Obviously, they are having pains," said Dick Bratt, vice president
of engineering and development for Spinnaker Software, a Cambridge, Mass.,
concern writing programs for the company.&nbsp; "There's a temptation to
jump on the coffin and start spitting nails in.&nbsp; But Jack Tramiel
is a winner.&nbsp; I wouldn't bet against him."
