<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over
the last 15 years I have actively participated in the Atari community in
one way or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1983 I got a hold of "Carnival
BBS" and totally wrote it from the ground up and ran the Star Trek BBS
in New York City until 1986 when it changed to The Earth Access Center
for Atari information and archives until around late 1988 or early 1989
when I shut it down.&nbsp; In spring of 1985 I was elected to run the Staten
Island Atari Users Group, and also participated in the Brooklyn Atari Users
group as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have been a member of the Ol' Hackers
users group for many years now.&nbsp; I actively participated on many local
and national BBS' and most frenquented Dateline: Atari and Fordham Prep
were I answered numerous Atari history questions and submitted articles
to newsletters and on-line databases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are just a few which
have survived over the years before moving to the web.</font>
