<p><font size=+1>Hi-Res was a short lived Atari Computer magazine. The
handwriting on my galley proof says, "Deadline for Issue 4 is Dec. 19,
1983."</font>
<p><font size=+1>Well, to make a long story short, Hi-Res folded and my
unpublished column lay burried under a stack of papers.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Until now.</font>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><font size=+2>"Have you been playing video games?" It's 1980, my first
week at Atari and the boss wants to know if I'm playing video games.</font>
<p><font size=+2>"Um ... a few but I've a good start on the assignment
you gave me," I mumble. "Forget the assignment. You like chess?" Steve
Harding, my boss, rushes around, finds a chess cartridge and shoves it
into the Atari Home Computer on my desk. "And you've got to go to the picnic
this afternoon ... no use staying around the office because everyone is
going to be at the park eating hamburgers and drinking beer."</font>
<p><font size=+2>Lately, I've been thinking about my two-year adventure
at Atari. It's the small things about Atari that have stayed in mind.</font>
<p><font size=+2>HALLOWEEN. Everyone dresses up in costumes. Mine was a
jester-fool outfit complete with bells that kept dripping down into my
eyes. Milt was a Rock and Roll singer, Embee was Cleopatra, and Glenda
was a road (a white center strip went up the middle of her bodysuit). A
Ubangi warrior marched with a large group of strange looking characters
through the Atari marketing department. The warrior kept pointing to a
roll of toilet paper on his spear saying, "Atari software, Atari software."</font>
<p><font size=+2>CAFETERIA. The engineering building had its own cafeteria.
Great place to. Programmers used to play word games with the movable letters
on the "soup of the day" sign. They would try to make a word or words that
used all the letters in "chicken soup," for example.</font>
<p><font size=+2>SCHLADGE CARDS. These handy cards got you in and out of
the various Atari departments. If you were not allowed into a department,
the Schlage card device would make a clicking sound and your attempt was
recorded on a computer somewhere. Rumor had it that Atari engineers tried
to figure out how the cards worked. They succeeded in making fake cards
within 15 minutes. Steve Harding says one of the founding engineers forgot
his Schlage card one weekend day and kicked the door down to get in.</font>
<p><font size=+2>APPLE SIGN. One bright and sunny day an Apple Computer
warehouse appeared next to the cubic monolith that was Atari's engineering
building. Some of the Atari people grabbed a brightly colored sign with
an Apple on it and placed it in the Atari engineering department. Two months
later, uniformed police officers showed up to reclaim the sign.</font>
<p><font size=+2>T-SHIRTS. T-shirts and jeans were something of a status
symbol at Atari. I swear my boss had a whole T-shirt wardrobe. He even
had a T-shirt with a tie painted on it. A young lady named Carlina came
up with the idea and design of the "I'm a high strung prima donna T-shirt."
The shirt had a picture of an opera singer and was in response to a Kassar
interview in the San Jose Mercury-News. I remember my friend Milt made
several outrageous prototype T-shirt designs for Carlina to consider. But
Milt's designs, clever as they were, lost out to Carlina's own design.</font>
<p><font size=+2>ASTEROIDS. In the lobby of the engineering building, someone
changed the flying saucers to flying turtles. OK, who changed the shape
table in the Asteroids game?</font>
<p><font size=+2>RUMORS. I'm not sure I believe it, but there was a rumor
about two ladies wrestling on the floor for the right to be a certain boss's
secretary.</font>
<p><font size=+2>Alas, that was before I got there. Steve Harding and others
tell me the Atari I knew was a shadow of its former self. "Times are changing,"
they would say.</font>
<p><font size=+2>Someone at Atari showed me an old newsletter entitled
"The Gospel According to St. Pong." It gave Nolan Bushnell's vision of
what a company should be like. I don't remember much of the philosophy
except that it seemed concerned mostly with worker happiness.</font>
<p><font size=+2>In conclusion, let me give you an opinion -- Atari has
done some things awfully right.</font>
<p><font size=+2>--------------------</font>
<p><font size=+2>A shakeout is happening in the video games industry. Shakeouts
are to electronics what earthquakes are to nature. Fox Video Games has
decided to call it quits. But Activision and Imagic seem to be weathering
the storm.</font>
<p><font size=+2>There has been a flood of video games in the marketplace
and a lot of price cutting. Experts say this comes about because video
game are not a mature industry. In a mature industry like the cigarette
industry, companies often agree price cuts are like cutting each other's
throats.</font>
<p><font size=+2>This predatory pricing means on can find some deals on
video games right now. I saw video games priced two for $2.95 at a recent
electronics show. Better shop for your video game bargains now. After the
shakeout, video game makers might start acting like the "mature" cigarette
industry. Hint: The new Atari chairman used to be an executive vice president
of marketing at Phillip Morris.</font>
<p><font size=+2>Recently this Silicon Valley Reporter had a fun conversation
with Jan Martin-Risk of Activision's consumer division. She finds it interesting
that, historically, man has used his highest technology to amuse himself.
To Martin-Risk, games are an art form and entertainment. The test of the
success of a game is a question each person can ask. Is it fun? If you
think the answer is yes -- then the game you are playing is a success.</font>
<p><font size=+2>There is a rumor that when Atari's Steve Wright was on
the "TODAY" show with Martin-Risk he got very nervous about something.
It's hard to imagine Steve Wright (Mr. Confident) nervous about anything.</font>
<p><font size=+2>What evidently happened was the host asked about Activision's
policy of giving game designers credit for their games. Martin-Risk explained
the author of a game program is like the author of a book and deserved
his or her name to be known. In voicing the opinion a video game is a corporate
product, Wright became a little tongue-tied.</font>
<p><font size=+2>A programmer recently gave this reporter a photocopied
masterpiece ... "Real Programmers Don't use PASCAL:"</font>
<p><font size=+2>Highlights include:</font>
<p><font size=+2>Real Programmers don't need comments -- the code is obvious.</font>
<p><font size=+2>At a party, Real Programmers are in the corner talking
about operating system security and how to get around it.</font>
<p><font size=+2>At a football game, the Real Programmer is comparing the
plays against his simulation printed on 11-by-14 fanfold paper.</font>
<p><font size=+2>No Real Programmer works 9 to 5.</font>
<p><font size=+2>Real Programmers don't know how to cook. Grocery stores
aren't open a 3 a.m. Real Programmers survive on Twinkies and coffee.</font>
<p><font size=+2>It seems video game players and programmers fit the description
quite nicely, too.</font>
