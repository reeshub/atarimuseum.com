<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Sunnyvale, Calif -- Atari Corp.
will score a new level of videogame perf-</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">ormance this fall with the introduction
of Jaguar, a 64-bit RISC-based</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">system offering realtime 3-D shaded
surfaces with texture mapping.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The $200 system, able to tap into
the growing network of cable and</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">telephone video services, will take
videogames into a graphics realm once</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">the province of midrange 3-D workstations.
In yet a further departure, the</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">system will be built by IBM Corp.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Jaguar, billed as an interactive
multimedia system, is based on an Atari-</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">designed proprietary 64-bit RISC
processor and its proprietary digital</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">signal processors. The cartridge-based
system features 24-bit true color</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">graphics, shaded 3-D polygons and
realtime texture mapping.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Atari claims that Jaguar offers
four times the processing power of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">current 16-bit videogames form Sega
and Nintendo, and believes it is even</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">more powerful than the coming 32-bit
ARM CPU-based machine from 3DO Co.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">"If a spaceship goes around a moon,
or a person walking on a street turns</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">on the next corner, every object,
every detail in such scenes is reproduced</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">in shaded 3-D images with texture.
It's truly amazing stuff," said Atari</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">president Sam Tramiel.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Dense ASICs</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The system's graphics performance
is compared by the company to that of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">3-D engines in midrange Unix workstations.
And like those engines, Jaguar</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">is based on advanced, very dense
digital ASICs.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Jaguar's core consists of two chip
sets, one holding the 64-bit RISC</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">processor and the other containing
DSP hardware. "But the partitioning</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">between the two chip sets is ambiguous,"
said Richard Miller, vice</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">president of research and development
at Atari, as the two share some</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">functions. The two sets apparently
pack a whole range of components,</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">including controllers, video processors
and encoders, leaving outside the</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">core only "a very small amount of
TTLs and DRAMs," said Miller. They were</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">designed at an Atari facility in
England, said Tramiel.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The 64-bit RISC processor is capable
of processing video data at a high</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">rate, handling various video effects
as well as full-motion video com-</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">pression on its own, Miller claimed.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Lots of bandwidth</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Atari would not disclose any more
about the core ASICs, such as gate counts</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">or data bandwidth, but Miller pointed
out that Atari engineers had to</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">concentrate most of their design
efforts on bus bandwidth. "Graphics eats a</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">lot of bus bandwidth. What's available
today for other 64-bit processors</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">such as PowerPC is only just enough
for what we want to do," he said. "What</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">we designed is right up on the level
of expensive 64-bit processors."</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">To meet its cost goals, Atari had
to push ASIC technology to the limit. The</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">chip sets will be manufactured by
"one of the top four silicon vendors in</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">the world" using the "smallest geometry"
available, said Miller. It is</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">believed that with Jaguar Atari
has become one of the early customers for a</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">major Japanese 0.5-micron ASIC process,
but the company would not confirm</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">this.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Clearly, manufacturing volume is
essential to the Jaguar plan. The company</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">intends to introduce an add-on PC
card featuring the company's proprietary</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">64-bit RISC processor, said Tramiel.
"It could also help minimize the cost</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">of our chip sets," he said.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Atari is also considering licensing
the chip set to other silicon vendors,</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">but has not determined any details
yet, said Tramiel.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The future holds more integration.
But before working on the ultimate, a</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">system on a chip, the next step
for Atari's engineering team is to shrink</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">what is currently a set of rather
large custom chips further, reducing the</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">whole system to "one processor,
one DRAM, one ROM and one custom chip,"</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">said Miller. The company is looking
at both synchronous DRAMs and Rambus</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">DRAMs for future use, "but we are
waiting to see some of the standards</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">issues get settled first," he noted.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Miller does have a technological
wish list. "First," he said, "we'd love to</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">have 0.3-micron process technology
as soon as possible for custom ICs.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Second, we'd like to see some form
of synchronous DRAMs appear as a</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">standard commodity DRAM, and, naturally,
a very high bus bandwidth to</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">produce higher video performance.
The existing improvements for faster bus</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">interfaces so far have been very
disappointing for us. Lastly, I'd love to</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">play the Atari Jaguar system on
a 10 x 10-foot display. I'm waiting for a</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">very low cost, low power, large-screen-size
display, using probably not an</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">active matrix but FED-type technology."</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">In the long run, Jaguar is designed
not just as a cartridge-based game</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">machine. It will use a 32-bit expansion
port to connect to cable and</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">telephone networks, and a digital
signal processing port for modem usage</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">and connection to digital audio
peripherals.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">This I/O structure reflects Time
Warner's 25 percent stake in Atari. "In</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">the course of our product development,
we've had frequent discussions with</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Time Warner. It has set the direction
for our machine to have cable and</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">telephone connections," said Leonard
Tramiel, vice president of operating</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">systems.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The company designed and built a
16-bit prototype home-entertainment</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">machine two years ago, said Sam
Tramiel, but scrapped the plan in favor of</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">a grand attempt to leapfrog the
16-bit systems that were then coming onto</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">the market. But when Atari engineers
stated to look for enabling</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">technology, "there were no RISC
processors and no DSPs that fulfilled our</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">requirements, especially at our
cost," said Miller. Atari's design team</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">even had to develop its own HDL
simulation tools, he said.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">"People tend to forget that, unlike
business users, consumers do have much</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">higher expectations in video quality,
speed and cost," Miller said. "In</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">order to match that demand, we had
to really push the technological</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">envelope, driving the chip counts
down, designing the system to be highly</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">manufacturable and depending on
the smallest geometry process technology."</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">IBM the OEM</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Atari will also push the envelope
in another way, turning its back on tra-</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">ditional East Asian manufacturing
sites and calling on IBM to build Jaguar.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">IBM, working with a 30-month contract
worth $500 million, will be res-</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">ponsible for component sourcing,
quality testing, console assembly,</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">packaging and distribution, and
will build the system at its Charlotte,</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">N.C. facility. The motherboard will
come from an IBM-approved manufacturer,</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">said Herbert Watkins, director of
application solutions manufacturing at</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">IBM Charlotte.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">For IBM, producing the Atari Jaguar
system makes it for the first time a</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">major OEM for highly cost-competitive,
mass consumer-electronics products,</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Watkins noted.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">"To manufacture one of the most
sophisticated game machines in the world,</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">we needed someone who understood
a high-volume, fast digital machine," said</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Miller. "IBM was a natural choice."</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">According to IBM, the prototypes
of the Atari Jaguar system will come out</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">in July, ramp-up models in August
and mass-production versions in</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">September. The system will be available
first on a limited basis in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">fall in the New York and San Francisco
areas. A national rollout is</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">scheduled for next year.</FONT>
