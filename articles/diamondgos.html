&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Article was published in the
Summer 88 issues of the Staten Island Atari Users Group newsletter.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The article was also posted onto the Fordham Prep BBS in the Bronx, NY.&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the time, the bulletin board system that Curt Vendel ran had changed
from being run in 83-86 as the Star Trek BBS to The Earth Access Center
in 86-89 to present Atari articles and data.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; During the initial development of Diamond, Alan Reeve sent
Curt Vendel Version 1.0 onto diskette and Curt Vendel proceeded to work
using an Apple Lisa XL with MacPaint and created all new icons for the
Diamond desktop which were null modem'd into an Atari 130XE and using MicroPainter
were converted into Atari format and mailed out to Alan.&nbsp;&nbsp; In
release 2.0 and 2.1 the new icons became the final icons used in the Diamond
GOS operating system.

<br>June 6, 1988&nbsp; Diamond(tm) Press Release Info&nbsp;&nbsp; Attention
Atari XL and XE
<br>owners. REEVE Software, developers of the powerful News Station page
layout
<br>software, will soon be releasing our powerful new graphics based operating
<br>system. It is called Diamond(tm) and when loaded into an XL/XE computer
with
<br>64K or more, gives your computer a complete graphics operating system
similar
<br>to what GEOS(tm) has done for the Commodore 64. This document gives
complete
<br>information on what Diamond(tm) can do from a programmers point of
view, and I
<br>think you'll agree that Atari XL/XE owners are in for a real treat
this year.
<br>Diamond(tm) is our powerful new graphics based operating system. It
allows your
<br>Atari computer to use the icon based point-and-click menu systems that
are
<br>present on many of the more powerful systems today such as the Macintosh(tm),
<br>Amiga(tm), and Atari ST(tm), and better yet, is the fact that Diamond(tm)
is
<br>not a single program that uses drop-down menus and icons, but rather
an
<br>environment which means there will be many more programs to come that
are
<br>Diamond(tm) based&nbsp;&nbsp; Diamond's(tm) features include  A mouse cursor which can
<br>be operated by the keyboard, a joystick, a touch tablet, or a mouse.
It is
<br>definable in shape and its point of action can be changed (e.g. an
arrows point
<br>of action would be its tip, and a crosshairs point of action would
be its
<br>center.) &nbsp;&nbsp; Drop-Down Menus that can have menu options activated
and
<br>deactivated which is indicated by highlighting active items. Menu items
can
<br>also have check marks placed and removed from them. These function
are all
<br>handled by Diamond(tm).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Desk Accessories which can be
called up from any
<br>Diamond(tm) based program at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Icons that can
be activated through
<br>a point-and-click system with a mouse. Icons can be shaped and moved
all around
<br>as part of our environment. &nbsp;&nbsp; Dialog Boxes that are virtually
unlimited in
<br>design to allow the user to make easy selections that require anything
from a
<br>simple yes/no response to anything one can think of. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Windows that can be
<br>opened, closed, moved, and sized via simple software calls. &nbsp;&nbsp;
...and many
<br>more powerful routines that make up the Diamond(tm) environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Most of
<br>what has been said up until now deals with Diamond(tm) as an environment,
and
<br>is meant to let you know that Diamond(tm) is an environment that can
easily be
<br>accessed by anyone that knows how to program, however, Diamond(tm)
is intended
<br>to make computing more fun for those that do not know how to program,
or even
<br>know how to use a computer. The primary purpose of an environment such
as this
<br>is to make computing easy and enjoyable, and this is a user interface
allowing
<br>people to communicate more easily with their computer. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Diamond(tm) is
<br>scheduled for July release and includes our Diamond DeskTop software,
which
<br>acts as a substitute for those select a letter and command oriented
systems. It
<br>allows users to perform every standard DOS function via a simple user
friendly
<br>command such as deleting a file or dragging the file over to the trash
can, and
<br>the user doesn't have to use the keyboard unless absolutely necessary
as in
<br>renaming a file. &nbsp;&nbsp; Diamond(tm) DeskTop will also be compatible
with Floppy
<br>Drives, Hard Drives, and Ram Disks as well as most Disk Operating Systems
such
<br>as Atari DOS 2.5 and SpartaDOS(tm).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We hope that Diamond(tm)
becomes the
<br>new standard of operating environments for Atari 8-bit owners as we
have
<br>designed it with excellent flexibility and power. Diamond which includes
<br>Diamond DeskTop and some additional programs and Desk Accessories will
retail
<br>for $29.95 as will our other Diamond based products. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Diamond should pump
<br>new life into your Atari 8-bit computer, and in order to put even more
