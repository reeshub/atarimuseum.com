Here are some excerpts of Atari's Form 10K that clearly show Atari's future directions and past motivations over the last six months:
<p>

"... Jaguar sales were
substantially below Atari's expectations, and Atari's business and financial
results were materially adversely affected in 1995 as Atari continued to invest
heavily in Jaguar game development, entered into arrangements to publish certain
licensed titles and reduced the retail price for its Jaguar console unit. Atari
attributes the poor performance of Jaguar to a number of factors including (i)
extensive delays in development of software for the Jaguar which resulted in
reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles for the platform would
be released and how many titles would ultimately be available, and (ii) the
introduction of competing products by Sega and Sony in May 1995 and September
1995, respectively. Atari presently has a substantial unsold inventory of Jaguar
and related products and there can be no assurance that such inventory can be
sold at current prices.
<p>
By late 1995, Atari recognized that despite the significant commitment of
financial resources that were devoted to the Jaguar and related products, it was
unlikely that Jaguar would ever become a broadly accepted video game console or
that Jaguar technology would be broadly adopted by software title developers. As
a result, Atari decided to significantly downsize its Jaguar operations. This
downsizing resulted in significant reductions in Atari's workforce, and
significant curtailment of research and development and sales and marketing
activities for Jaguar and related products. Accordingly, Atari decided to focus
its efforts on selling its inventory of Jaguar and related products and to
emphasize its existing licensing and development activities related to
multimedia entertainment software for various platforms.
<p>
Most
of Atari's competitors have greater experience and expertise in 3D graphics and
multimedia technology and have substantially greater engineering, marketing and
financial resources than Atari.
<p>
Atari has placed no manufacturing orders for the Jaguar console since
mid-1995. Based on current and expected sales and inventory levels, Atari does
not intend to pursue additional Jaguar manufacturing. The Jaguar console unit
was assembled in the United States by a third-party subcontractor under a
manufacturing arrangement." 

<p>
<I>As reported by numerous sources, Starting at the end of last year, Atari was "trying to liquidate inventories" of Jaguar products.  Strangely enough, Atari's official line to this day is that they will continue to support the Jaguar.</I>

<H3>Legal Proceedings</H3>
 <p>

 "Atari is a defendant in a civil action brought in the Superior Court of the
State of California in and for the County of Santa Clara by Citizen America
Corporation, a former supplier, in February 1994 seeking damages of
approximately $900,000 for alleged breach of contract and related claims. Atari
believes this action will have no material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition or results of operations.*
<p> 
     Atari is a defendant and counter claimant in a civil action for alleged
breach of contract brought in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
New York, case number 95 Civ. 1945, by Tradewell, Inc., a New York corporation,
seeking specific performance for release of goods having a value of $1.6
million. Atari has counterclaimed seeking specific performance for the purchase
of media or, alternatively, damages in the amount of $3.3 million. As a result
of a partial settlement, Atari now seeks damages of approximately $1.3 million.
Atari believes this action will have no material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition or results of operations.*
<p> 
- ---------------
<p> 
* This statement is a forward-looking statement reflecting current expectations.
  Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the
  forward-looking statement due to numerous factors, including the risk related
  factors set forth herein.
<p>                                          
     Atari is a plaintiff in a civil action brought in the Superior Court of the
State of California in and for the County of Santa Clara brought against
Phillips Laser Magnetic Storage ("Phillips") for breach of contract and breach
of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing arising out of Phillips'
failure to deliver goods to Atari. Atari has been advised that Phillips intends
to file an unspecified counterclaim. Atari believes this action will have no
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of
operations.*
<p> 
     Atari is a plaintiff in a civil action brought in the Superior Court of the
State of California in and for the County of Santa Clara and removed to the
United States District Court, Northern District of California brought against
Probe Entertainment Limited and Acclaim Entertainment for breach of contract and
related claims. Counterclaims have been filed against Atari for alleged breach
of contract. Atari believes this action will have no material adverse effect on
its business, financial condition or results of operations.*
<p> 
     Atari is not aware of any other pending legal proceedings against Atari and
its consolidated subsidiaries other than routine litigation incidental to their
normal business.
<p>
 In connection with the restructuring of Atari's business in 1992 and 1993
and Atari's decision in late 1995 to significantly downsize its Jaguar
operations, Atari has terminated and plans to terminate numerous contracts and
business relationships, including several related to software development
activities. The termination of contracts and relationships has, from time to
time, resulted in litigation, diverting management and financial resources.
There can be no assurance that the parties to such contracts will not commence
or threaten to commence litigation related to such contracts. Any such
litigation or threatened litigation would further divert management and
financial resources and could have a material adverse effect on Atari's
business, operating results and financial condition." 

<p>
<I>Typical of Atari's business tactics, legal proceedings often figure prominently in their financial documents.  Atari's intellectual properties are one of their most valuable assets, and the Tramiels have rarely allowed them to be tread upon without legal repercussions.  Both Sega and Nintendo have at one time or another been on the opposite side of the courtroom from Atari and each has lost considerable resources to Atari's legal staff.

<p>

<H3>The New Chapter Begins:</H3>
<p>
"The Merger.  At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a Certificate of
Merger prepared in accordance with Delaware Law (as defined herein) and Nevada
Law (as defined herein) and reasonably acceptable to counsel to JTS and counsel
to Atari (the "Certificate of Merger"), and the applicable provisions of the
Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law") and Nevada General Corporation
Law ("Nevada Law"), Atari shall be merged with and into JTS, the separate
corporate existence of Atari shall cease and JTS shall continue as the surviving
corporation. JTS as the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the 'Surviving Corporation.'
<p>
Directors and Executive Officers.  At the Effective Time, the directors
of the Surviving Corporation shall be Sirjang Lal Tandon, David T. Mitchell,
Jean D. Deleage, Alan Azan, Roger W. Johnson, LipBu Tan, Jack Tramiel and
Michael Rosenberg. The executive officers of JTS immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall constitute the only executive officers of the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time, unless otherwise designated by JTS."
<p>
<I>As can be seen here two of Atari's executive officers have found positions on the board of the new corporation.  Exactly how much sway is held over JTS by Jack Tramiel and Michael Rosenberg remains to be seen.</I>
