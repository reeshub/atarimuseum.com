<P>Interview by Curt Vendel of the Atari Museum.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>CV:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did you get involved with Atari and the 2600
project?
<P>JD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was hired in December 1975.&nbsp; I started
working for Steve Mayer and Ron Milner at Cyan in Grass Valley CA.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- My first job was to help debug a concept prototype for what became the
2600.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This was hardware and software (Ron did the hardware, Steve did a Tank
prototype.)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- In March of 1976 I moved to Los Gatos CA to apprentice for Jay Miner,
the lead chip designer.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(The whole team moved to Sunnyvale in the fall of 1976.)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Redesigned the hardware with Jay, built &amp; debugged the hardware,
rewrote the core of the Tank game.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This included the system desing: 6507, 6532, TIA, controllers, cartridge
slot, etc.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Designed the sound circuit on the TIA chip, based on Ron Milner's prototype.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Wrote Video Olympics cartridge fromt the ground up, as a piece of test
code and then as a product.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Larry Wagner, the lead cartridge programmer, did a great job of reinventing
and productizing the Combat
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cartridge, including Tank, Jet Fighter and BiPlane.)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- While the basic 2600 chip and system were in production pipeline, we
redesigned it to work on PAL TVs, so
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
we could ship them to Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Big contributor: Niles Strohl.
<P>CV:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow, so you really had
your hand in the project from the ground up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you completed
the work on the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari 2600 project, what type of work at Atari did you do next?
<P>JD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Summer of 1977,
I went back to Grass Valley to work with Ron and Steve on the next generation
machine,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the progenitor for the Atari 800.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Went back to Sunnyvale to rethink the "Colleen" product as a system with
partitioned chips.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- I worked with a guy name Francois Michel to design the ANTIC chip.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- George McLeod designed the CTIA (Colleen TIA) and Doug Neubauer designed
the POKEY (POtentiometers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and KEYboard interface.)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- I wrote some games as test code, but none shipped.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most
interesting technically was a implementation of SuperBug.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this game, a car is in the center of the screen, and the entire enormous
driving course scrolls around it.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- I worked on the SIO bus, the Atari SIO was bound by how fast we could
run the wire, how well we could shield it, and how
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
much intelligence we could put outside.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a kludge, running
at 19,200 bps.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is an interesting and true story here:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the same time that we were designing the Atari 800, the Apple II was
on the market, and popular.&nbsp; It had slots, and we badly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
wanted to have slots in the Atari 800 (then called Colleen).
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari was dealing with the FCC under the Part 15 Type I rules, for anything
that actually generated TV channel RF.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those radiation
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
rules were much stricter then the Class A and Class B rules that common
computers must meet, so slots were out, and we ended up
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
wrapping the electronics in a 2mm thick aluminum casting.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
serial bus was our way of adding peripherals.&nbsp;&nbsp; (It was also
a very
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
expensive one.&nbsp; I think it sank the product.)
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Apple was dodging the FCC, by not including the RF modulator
themselves.&nbsp; You had to buy it from someone else and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
install it yourself.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, in early 1978, a TI salesman walked in to try and sell us a cheap fiber
optic cable with a transmitter molded on one end and a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
receiver molded on the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea that I had was: if we
build a computer which is optically isolated from the TV, then we
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
can just put the bundled fiber receiver and RF transmitter into the FCC
for approval, make a really quiet fiber-to-RF converter.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We could then do whatever we want in the PC including having slots.&nbsp;
I told this application to the TI sales guy whose eyes almost
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
popped out.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our engineering manager (Wade)&nbsp; said "No, the FCC would never let
us get away with that stunt."&nbsp;&nbsp; The TI salesman went off and
told his
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
people anyway, including the team we didn't know about who were designing
the new TI 99/4 home PC.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TI went to the FCC in 1979 trying to use the same idea.&nbsp; The FCC said
NO WAY.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a big stink, because TI's home
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
congressional district was represented by the then Speaker of the House
Jim Wright, a powerful man.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wade was jubilant.&nbsp; He said I could not have sabotaged TI better if
I had tried.&nbsp;&nbsp; The result of the whole mess was the generation
of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Class A and Class B specifications.
<P>CV:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So not only did
you work on some of the most important early projects at Atari, but you
helped to cause a set back with TI's release of its
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
home computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I'm sure everyone will appreciate
your stories of the work on the Atari 2600 and the Atari Colleen SIO bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I would like to thank you for your generous loan of the HUGE 6' by 6' photoplot
of the TIA which was on display in the Namco Museum at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the World of Atari 98' show this past August in Las Vegas.
