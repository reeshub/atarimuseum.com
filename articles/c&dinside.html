<P>A while back there was an amazingly informative post to rec.games.video.classic
about the movie Cloak and Dagger and its related video
<BR>games. Interestingly, around the time the movie was made Atari Corp.,
the home game division of Atari, was sold by Warner to the Tramiels.
<BR>There's some juicy information here about unreleased video games, cancelled
when the Tramiels decided to instead focus on their computer
<BR>line. Anyway, read on to learn all about it.
<P>(By the way, I should note a few inaccuracies in the below article -
Ms. Pac Man WAS released for the 5200; Atari's coin op division Atari
<BR>Games wasn't sold to Namco. It remained Atari Games until recently
becoming Time Warner Interactive.)
<P>Cloak and Dagger is now in MAME!

<BR>Subject: 5200 Cloak and Dagger cartridge
<BR>Date: Sun Sep 11 1994
<P>I came across this interesting bit during the summer. Many of you will
recognize Cloak and Dagger not only as an Atari coin-op game, but
<BR>also as the movie in which a box for the elusive 5200 Tempest appears
on a store shelf. During the summer I found a book called "The Films
<BR>of the Eighties" or something to that effect. It was a beautiful book
with tons of great photos, including one from "Cloak and Dagger".
<BR>Unfortunately it was not a picture of Tempest. It was however a very
large and clear picture of the kid from ET holding a very clearly labled
<BR>5200 Cloak and Dagger cartridge.
<P>Does anyone know of this game existing in any form? I've never seen
it listed among the prototypes in any list. It is of course very possible
that
<BR>the cartridge was just a mock-up, but knowing how Atari was in those
days, it very well could have been the only copy of Cloak and Dagger.
<BR>Discuss amongst yourselves.

<P>I'm under the impression that the cartridge was a mock-up. (In the film
they had tons of Cloak and Dagger boxes lying around etc.) The
<BR>arcade game is real though. It's a pretty good Robotron clone from
what I hear. I've never seen it myself.
<P>I love how in the movie (C&amp;D) they access the secret chip and this
rotation all-singing-all-dancing vector display comes up with speech etc.
<BR>Geez, if the 5200 could do all that, it would be on the cutting edge
today. :)

<BR>Re: 5200 Cloak and Dagger cartridge
<BR>Date: Mon Sep 12 1994
<P>I can give the definitive answer here. I used to work with the author
of the 5200 version of Cloak and Dagger. I've previously asked him
<BR>about it, and he had sent me the following message:
<P>--- CUT HERE ---
<BR>Yes, I can answer your question about the Atari 5200 version of Cloak
&amp; Dagger.
<P>When Warner Communications sold the consumer side of Atari to Jack Tramiel
(who founded Commodore) in mid-1984, I was working on
<BR>the Atari 400/800/1200 version of Cloak &amp; Dagger. Since the Atari
5200 was basically just an Atari 400 with a different controller, when
I
<BR>completed the home computer version, I was supposed to modify the game
to use the "360-degree" 5200 controller (as opposed to the
<BR>9-position home computer joystick).
<P>By the way here's a little known fact about Cloak &amp; Dagger: someone
at Atari actually explored doing an Atari 2600 version of Cloak &amp;
<BR>Dagger, but very quickly decided that it couldn't be done, even with
major simplifications...
<P>If you've ever seen the Cloak &amp; Dagger movie, you'll know that the
cartridge shown in the movie was a 5200 cartridge. Actually, the 5200
<BR>cartridge didn't even exist: it was a 5200 cartridge of another game
with a "Cloak &amp; Dagger" label slapped on it. Also, in the game store
<BR>scenes, there were Atari 5200 Cloak &amp; Dagger boxes shown. Those
were also just mockups made for the movie.
<P>But wait a second! Wasn't the Atari 5200 Cloak &amp; Dagger game actually
PLAYED in the movie (and didn't it look damn good)? Hollywood
<BR>movie magic! They took the output of the coin-operated game, converted
the signal, and piped it to a TV set. So if you thought it looked a lot
<BR>like the coin-op game, you were right. Another interesting fact: Henry
Thomas wasn't really playing the game; instead, Atari sent down the
<BR>game's software developer, Rusty Dawe, to play the coin-op game for
the movie! So they showed Henry Thomas furiously working the 5200
<BR>controller, cut to the television showing Rusty's progress in the game
(sometimes even with Henry's reflection in the screen), and back again.
<BR>Rusty -- er, make that Russell B. Dawe -- got his own full-screen credit
at the end of the movie for the game design.
<P>Although the rest of the game shown in the movie was taken from the
real coin-op game, the spectacular 3D "secret plans" finale of the game
<BR>was pure Holywood animation: the real game ends somewhat anti-climactically
with one of several static, crudely-drawn blueprints. I don't
<BR>recall whether Rusty ran short of ROM space or time, but the secret
plans weren't up to the quality of the rest of the game, much less the
<BR>movie game's ending.
<P>Oh, and another piece of trivia: the original name of the Cloak &amp;
Dagger coin-operated game was actually...Agent X (hence the name of the
<BR>protagonist in the game and the off-hand comment by Dabney Coleman
in the movie that he "used to be known as Agent X"). The game had
<BR>been under development at Atari as "Agent X" for quite a while, and
was nearly completed. The movie studio (can't remember which one
<BR>off-hand, but I have the Laserdisc) had the movie under development
as Cloak &amp; Dagger. The game cartridge that was in the original
<BR>screenplay was...Donkey Kong (at the time, the most popular home videogame)!
Someone at either the movie studio or Atari found out about
<BR>the other, "the secret agent recovers secret plans from bad guys" plots
sounded like they were made for each other, the deal was signed, and
<BR>the Agent X game was renamed Cloak &amp; Dagger.
<P>Anyway, back to the layoff. My half of Atari (the half that just released
the Jaguar videogame system; it's still known as "Atari, Inc.") got sold,
<BR>and they laid off almost all the game developers who didn't have experience
writing operating systems, myself included. When the layoffs
<BR>happened, I was close to halfway done with the game. The basic structure
of all the levels was done (conveyor belts, boxes, bubbling acid
<BR>pits, box manufacturers, minefields) and you could move Agent X around,
pick up boxes, and die from touching red boxes, being crushed by
<BR>the box manufacturing thingies (what the hell were they called?), stepping
in an acid pit, or touching a landmine (although the death animation
<BR>wasn't in yet, so you just turned pitch black).
<P>But none of the enemies were done, you couldn't shoot yet (although,
without enemies, you would only be able to shoot the boxes anyway),
<BR>and the bomb in the center didn't explode (the animation of the bomb
exploding in the coin-op game is fast, but it's actually pretty crude).
No
<BR>elevator scenes yet, either, although since the cartridge was supposed
to be the first Atari home computer cartridge to reach a whopping 32K
<BR>(all previous cartridges had been 16K or less!), there was enough room
for many -- if not all -- of the elevator animations. (If you look
<BR>closely, you'll notice that very little of Agent X actually moves in
the elevator scenes: an arm, a facial expression, smoke, an arm and a yo-yo,
<BR>etc.)
<P>In 1983, at one of Atari's periodic auctions of prototype and no longer
needed coin-operated machines (including games like DigDug and
<BR>Berzerk whose translations to Atari home computers and/or videogame
systems had already been completed), I bought one of the original 25
<BR>(I believe) Agent X machines. These prototypes, which had been sent
to arcades for test-marketing, had stereo sound (Atari went with mono
<BR>sound for the final hardware) and the pre-Cloak &amp; Dagger faceplates.
The ROMs were upgraded to reflect the name change, however, so,
<BR>on the inside, my machine is a real Cloak &amp; Dagger!
<P>Anyway, hope you enjoyed the history and stories. I'd always wanted
to finish the home computer version of Cloak &amp; Dagger, but over the
<BR>years, my free time has almost completed vanished. The Atari 5200 version
of Cloak &amp; Dagger, as well versions of many other classic Atari
<BR>games -- Crystal Castles (which was nearly finished when the layoff
happened), Major Havoc (one of my favorite coin-op games, but the
<BR>home computer conversion was barely started at the time of the layoffs),
and Ms. PacMan (completed, but not released), to name just a few
<BR>-- were all casualties of the sale of Atari's consumer business to
Tramiel and the resulting layoffs. Everyone who was left immediately switched
<BR>from developing games (new as well as conversions of coin-operated
games) to working on the operating system for the Atari 520ST and
<BR>1040ST.
<P>By the way, the coin-operated half of Atari remained with Warner Communications
for several months before it was sold to Namco, the
<BR>Japanese company that became famous with PacMan. The coin-operated
company is known as "Atari Games Corporation", as opposed to
<BR>Tramiel's "Atari, Incorporated".
<P>Sorry to dash your hopes about the Atari 5200 Cloak &amp; Dagger...
