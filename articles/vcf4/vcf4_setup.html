<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">8:00am and people are just starting to
unload and begin setting up.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Parkside Hall was actually</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a lot larger then I had expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let me tell you, the place filled up very quickly!!!</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="setup2.jpg" height=400 width=600>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By 9:00am things were starting to take
shape.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the coin-ops were delivered, tables were</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">starting to be setup and the partition
walls were being fork-lifted into the hall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around 9:30am
I</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">get a rather big surprise, in the form
of a big bear of man... Dave Stubben had shown up to say Hi and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">it was a real pleasure to spend about
15-20 minutes talking with Dave off-line about many things.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He had</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to run, but wanted to stop by and say
hi, thanks Dave!!! (Dave Stubben worked as a Fellow in Atari's</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Corporate Research Division).</font>
<p><img SRC="exhibits.jpg" height=400 width=600>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By 10:30am things were starting to really
take shape, people were running around like crazy getting</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">everything unpacked and in place and a
few curious on-lookers had snuck-in to take a peak before</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the exhbits officially opened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sellam stops by and reminds me, "Hey your up next to speak"&nbsp; Yikes!</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I'm not much of a speaker, but off I go
to the meeting room to do my speech on Atari (nothing prepared</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">ahead of time mind you! :-)&nbsp; I just
winged it and did some basic background on the history of company,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">did some question and answer sessions,
had some fun with the crowd with a Quiz on Atari history and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">gave out copies of Atari Arcade Hits #2
for PC's out to the crowd which were donated by Atari Interactive</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">for the show (Thanks Jayson!!!)</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To some of the crowds dismay... AAH#2 wouldn't
work on their Altairs or Imsai's :-)</font>
