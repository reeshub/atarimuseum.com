The show was a blast to sum it up in the simplest of terms!&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sellam, Alex, Bill and everyone else who assisted in setup and participated
all deserve a big round of applause as do the California Extreme team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No where has such a large assortment of both classic coinop and pinball
machines been assembled in one location since the days of the mega arcades
of the 80's.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I was originally invited to exhibit and speak at last years VCF 3.0 but
I was unable to attend due to a injury to me neck &amp; back.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well this year I was looking ver forward to attending and it was a true
of wills to make it to this years show.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had packed
and crated over 1,400 lbs of equipment into 4 large shipping crates and
they needed to go out on Monday September 25th by Forward Air shipping
out to California for arrival on Friday the 29th.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well
I rented out a U-Haul, loaded everything up and then proceeded to lose
the key to the rental truck.&nbsp; U Haul didn't have a spare and after
almost 3 hours with the locksmith trying to match keys time was running
out, I needed to get these crates to Forward Air by 11pm or I was out of
the show.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well at 10pm the locksmith pops the lock cylinder
out and gives me a 3 mins lesson on how to start and run the truck with
a screwdrives (oh joy!) and off I went to Forward Air, made it with 15
mins to spare (whew!!!) and off went the crates for a Friday arrival...
well not all of them, apparently 1 crate would end up being late and not
make it for the show with one of the display kiosks :-(</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
