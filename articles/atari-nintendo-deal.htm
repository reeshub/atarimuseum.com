        SUBJECT: Nintendo</font><br>
        <br>
        <font size="2">        As we discussed with Dave Stubben yesterday, I am to remove<br>
        myself from any further involvement with the Nintendo project<br>
        ..... and Dave has indicated that you are the one to take it<br>
        over.<br>
        <br>
        I have provided you with a copy of my file containing my previous<br>
        memos on the subject (with corrections); the approach letter from<br>
        Nintendo; all of the schematics and mechanical drawings of the<br>
        Nintendo machine which we have received to date; and Ed Levy's<br>
        mechanical drawings which attempt to fit the Nintendo machine<br>
        into the 2100 plastic.<br>
        <br>
        We spent the latter part of the afternoon yesterday discussing<br>
        the history of this deal and what needs to be done next by both<br>
        sides. Let me review those points here and expand upon them for<br>
        your reference.<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Henricks received a letter from Mr. Arakawa and Mr. Lincoln<br>
        of Nintendo America on April 4, 1983. In that letter, Nintendo<br>
        provided us with some preliminary specifications on their new<br>
        home video game machine. A couple of days later they came to meet<br>
        with Mr. Kassar to explore whether Atari had any interest in this<br>
        product. In addition to Messers Arakawa, Lincoln, Henricks, and<br>
        Kassar; Messers Groth, Malloy, Moone, Bruehl, Ruckert, and myself<br>
        were invited to attend. Mr. Malloy and I framed some of the<br>
        initial questions which needed to be answered about the<br>
        capabilities of the machine; and Mr. Lincoln promised to get the<br>
        answers to me within a few days. Those answers were sufficiently<br>
        intriquing to Mr. Groth that Alan Henricks, Dave Remson, and I<br>
        were asked to travel to Kyoto immediately to see their TTL<br>
        emulator in action and get more details about the final product.<br>
        <br>
        On the 11th of April, 1983, we met with Nintendo at their<br>
        headquarters in Kyoto. By happenstance (fortunate or<br>
        unfortunate), a large contingent of Atari executives were in the<br>
        Far East for other reasons .... and they all decided to come to<br>
        Kyoto to have a look, too. In attendance from Atari were Messers.<br>
        Bruehl, Moone, Malloy, Lynch, Hennick, Mitoh, Henricks, Remson,<br>
        and myself. Attending on Nintendo's behalf were Messers. Yamauchi<br>
        (President), Takeda (Manager of R&amp;D, Coin-Op), Arakawa (Pres.<br>
        Nintendo America), Lincoln (internal attorney for Nintendo<br>
        America), Uemura (Manager of R&amp;D, Consumer Products), Todori<br>
        (Export Manager), and two of their electrical engineers.<br>
        <br>
        We were shown working (but not complete) versions of Donkey Kong<br>
        Junior and Popeye running with only minor display glitches on<br>
        their TTL emulator. A VHS video tape (without sound) of that demo<br>
        is attached to this memo. Please keep in mind that the actual TV<br>
        image is significantly better than could be captured on tape. In<br>
        fact, there is a noticable difference when viewing the composite<br>
        video output on a monitor as opposed to the RF output on a<br>
        standard TV receiver.<br>
        <br>
        At that time, Nintendo had only just received their 1st pass<br>
        silicon (with some bugs) and were not able to show us a fully<br>
        assembled and working prototype. My memo of 4/16/83 (with<br>
        corrections) describes what we saw and were told in that meeting.<br>
        <br>
        On 4/15/83, Messers Kassar, Groth, Moone, Bruehl, Paul, Henricks,<br>
        Remson, and myself met in Mr. Groth's office to view the videotape<br>
        and discuss what we had learned from the meeting on the 11th and<br>
        what we knew to-date on the MARIA chip being developed by General<br>
        Computer. As both systems were seen as being in the same price<br>
        range with graphics capabilities superior to the 2600 and<br>
        comparable (and in some features, superior) to the 5200, it was<br>
        felt that we needed to see what could be done with both machines<br>
        for an intermediate priced game machine .... the 3600.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I was asked to become as completely informed about the MARIA chip<br>
        as possible so that a reasoned choice could be made between the<br>
        two machines. To that end, I have spoken with the folks at General<br>
        Computer several times by telephone and have made two trips to<br>
        their offices in Cambridge, Mass. It appears to be a superior<br>
        machine, but the MARIA chip is not yet finished. First silicon is<br>
        not expected until mid-July (if there are no further schedule<br>
        delays). Also, since this chip is a VTI device there is some<br>
        question as to the manufacturability/testability/cost of the chip.<br>
        In other words, it will not be until mid-July (mid-August if the<br>
        first silicon is faulty) that we will be able to make a fully<br>
        informed choice between the Nintendo and the MARIA machines.<br>
        Therefore, it was decided by Executive Management that in any<br>
        negotiations with Nintendo we would need to string out the<br>
        signing until at least mid-July.<br>
        <br>
        We were committed to respond quickly to Nintendo, however, as to<br>
        whether we were interested or not. So, Alan Henricks did contact<br>
        Nintendo with the word that we were interesting in continuing the<br>
        discussions; and the next negotiating meeting was arranged for May<br>
        17th in Kyoto. Skip Paul and Alan Henricks were to represent<br>
        Atari. Two or three days before that meeting, Nintendo informed<br>
        Mr. Henricks that they would be having their senior engineering<br>
        managers present in the negotiations, and Nintendo requested my<br>
        attendance as well.<br>
        <br>
        That negotiating session began with a statement from Mr. Yamauchi<br>
        as to the terms and conditions which he demanded, namely:<br>
        <br>
                1. that Atari would purchase the assembled and tested<br>
                   main pc board for the FCS from Nintendo, for sale<br>
                   outside of Japan. Nintendo would sell the FCS on its<br>
                   own in Japan.<br>
        <br>
                2. after some minimum purchase of assembled and tested pc<br>
                   boards, we would be able to buy the 2 custom chips<br>
                   from Nintendo without having to have Nintendo assemble<br>
                   them into the final unit.<br>
        <br>
                3. that Nintendo would only disclose the electrical specs<br>
                   for the PPU and CPU, the circuit diagram of the FCS<br>
                   system, the test programs, and the "cassette" specs<br>
                   (meaning the ROM cartridge and cartridge edge<br>
                   connector specs).<br>
        <br>
                4. that there would be no disclosure to Atari of the<br>
                   programming specs for the PPU and the CPU.<br>
        <br>
                5. that Nintendo would program titles of our choice for<br>
                   the FCS system and would sell us the assembled and<br>
                   tested, unlabeled ROM carts at 1,500 Yen each FOB<br>
                   Japan for retail sale by Atari. The minimum quantity<br>
                   required by Nintendo per title would be 100,000 units<br>
                   and at that level there would be no fee for<br>
                   non-recurring engineering/programming expenses.<br>
        <br>
                6. that Atari would hereby obtain a "right of 1st<br>
                   refusal" on future Nintendo coin-op titles for use<br>
                   worldwide (outside of Japan) only for the Nintendo FCS<br>
                   system .... again, by programming and manufacturing<br>
                   those carts themselves for sale to us.<br>
        <br>
                7. that the cost of the assembled and tested main pc<br>
                   board would be higher than the 5,300 Yen quoted<br>
                   earlier to cover the cost of FCC compatibility. Also,<br>
                   that the resulting new pc board would not fit into the<br>
                   plastic being used by Nintendo for this unit in Japan.<br>
        <br>
        By the time we finished the negotiations on that trip (5/17 -<br>
        5/20), the deal was changed to be as follows:<br>
        <br>
                A. Nintendo would disclose all items called for in my<br>
                   memo of 5/13/83 (to Henricks and Paul) except for item<br>
                   13., namely, the LSI tapes for chip fabrication. This<br>
                   disclosure would take place upon signing of the deal.<br>
                   All items which are originally in Japanese are to be<br>
                   furnished to us both in Japanese and in English.<br>
        <br>
                B. Upon signing the deal, Nintendo would reassure Atari<br>
                   about the source of supply of the 2 custom chips.<br>
        <br>
                C. Any increases in the cost of the main pc board due to<br>
                   FCC compliance will be a straight cost pass through<br>
                   (no additional profit to Nintendo).<br>
        <br>
                D. Atari and Nintendo would work together to attempt to<br>
                   legal protect the CPU and PPU designs.<br>
        <br>
                E. Nintendo would receive $5. Mil upon signing as an<br>
                   advance against future payments.<br>
        <br>
                F. Atari would have to commit to a minimum purchase of 2<br>
                   million hardware units (some mixture of assembled and<br>
                   tested pc boards and CPU/PPU chip sets) over the term<br>
                   of the contract.<br>
        <br>
                G. The term of the contract would be 4 years with a 4<br>
                   year option to renew.<br>
        <br>
                H. Nintendo would receive an additional $3.5 Mil in a<br>
                   line of credit as an advance upon future payments upon<br>
                   delivery of the 1st production-ready prototype of the<br>
                   PAL West Germany version of the FCS (no later than<br>
                   1/1/84). Similarly, an additional advance of $1.5 Mil<br>
                   for SECAM.<br>
        <br>
                I. The 2 million unit commitment would be broken-up into<br>
                   1 million NTSC, 700,000 PAL, and 300,000 SECAM. If<br>
                   Atari goes over in one catagory, it would directly<br>
                   reduce our requirement in any other catagory of our<br>
                   choice. As Skip Paul likes to put it, "cross-<br>
                   collateralization is the key!"<br>
        <br>
                J. Nintendo would commit to produce 100,000 units of the<br>
                   assembled and tested pc board by August 31st if the<br>
                   new pc design (to include FCC and to fit whatever<br>
                   plastic we choose) can be completed by Nintendo<br>
                   and approved by Atari by July 20th. In essence,<br>
                   unlimited quanities (in excess of 1 million/month)<br>
                   thereafter .... upon 3 months notice from Atari.<br>
        <br>
                K. Atari will have the right to program for this system<br>
                   with the full assistance of Nintendo.<br>
        <br>
                L. Nintendo will, in the interests of expediency for this<br>
                   Christmas season, program 4 Atari titles of our<br>
                   choice. Source and object code which meets our<br>
                   satisfaction (with respect to basic design, tuning,<br>
                   and bug-free) to be delivered to us no later than<br>
                   Sept. 1, 1983. The fee would be $100,000./title or<br>
                   no non-recurring engineering fees would be charged as<br>
                   long as we buy a minimum of 100,000 carts.<br>
        <br>
                M. Carts would cost us 1,500 Yen/cart if in plastic but<br>
                   unlabeled or 1,350 Yen if not in plastic (F.O.B.<br>
                   Japan). Rate of production would be max. 5,000<br>
                   units/week/title<br>
