<p>No Software for your 8-bits???
<p>&nbsp;Are you sitting at your Atari 400,800,1200,Xl,Xe complaining about
NO
<br>SOFTWARE!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Well lets start off first by saying: No Software,
WRONG, plenty
<br>of software, yes I'll admit new titles have been a bit scarce, but
have you
<br>ever thought about looking to the past???&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever
heard of a nice
<br>little software company called Microprose?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, these
people make some very
<br>fine quality products for your computer's.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following
are 2 reviews of
<br>some old, new? software they sell.
<p>F-15 Strike Eagle:
<p>&nbsp;If your a simulations nut, you are hooked on getting into a game
with some
<br>realism and have watched Top Gun for the 147th time on your VCR then
this is
<br>the game for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sega recently released into the arcades
a new game called
<br>After Burner, a fantastic fighter combat simulation which is in a 3-dimensional
<br>movement cabinet, this game costs $1.00 per game and you get hooked
very
<br>quickly and your money disappears even faster, and another problem,
just like
<br>Chinese food, an hour after you get home from the arcade, you want
MORE!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; So
<br>you look at your Atari and say: Hey! I've got a computer with superior
graphics
<br>and sound, why not an Afterburner for my Atari?&nbsp; Well in 1985
Microprose
<br>answered a lot of peoples dreams, Strike Eagle.&nbsp; A simple yet
intense fighter
<br>-More-
<br>combat simulator.&nbsp; The graphics are semi-3-D, you are giving a
REAL VIEW
<br>perspective so its just like sitting in the cockpit of an F-15, you
have
<br>varying radar, overall map of different missions which take multiple
<br>engagements to complete (from 5-10 carrier landings and refuelings)
to knock
<br>out airports, SAM missile sites and your primary target.&nbsp; Libya,
Egypt, and many
<br>other targets are available.&nbsp; The simulation is real life, weight,
fuel, air
<br>drag, G-force are all considered so you have to stay very alert or.
. .
<br>For $20 this game is well worth adding to your library, it may be old,
but it's
<br>HOT.
<p>The TOP GUNNER Collection:
<p>&nbsp;Some oldies but goodies make a come back.&nbsp; Microprose has
decided to package 2
<br>of its fighter simulations and 1 arcade style rescue game into a $18
package, 3
<br>games for 1 price.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first game is Mig Alley Ace.&nbsp;
You are the pilot of an
<br>old 1950 Mig jet fighter as you got head to head in varied confrontations
<br>against the computer or an opponent.&nbsp; The screen is split in half,
top
<br>half/bottom half so each pilot can see what the other is doing, its
like
<br>cheating, but how else can 2 people play at the same time and still
have real
<br>view perspective?&nbsp; The game action is good and can get intense
at moments.
<br>Just like the real old time Migs, your plane is difficult to keep complete
<br>control over so you have to get used to it.&nbsp; Another added amount
of reality is
<br>that your ammo (bullets, sorry no medium range missile here...) they
curve downward,
<br>making the killing of your target very difficult, but with some skill
<br>and with a watchful eye you pick up a trick or two on how to use gravity
to
<br>your advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next game is Hellcat Ace:&nbsp;
Again its time for some heavy
<br>action and a shoot out in your WW II propeller driven fighter, your
in a real
<br>view perspective, like with F-15 Strike eagle, and bullets are the only
thing
<br>between you coming home in one piece, or becoming a future tourist
attraction
<br>somewhere in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok the next game I'm not crazy about,
but your little
<br>brother or sister might think it's cute:&nbsp; Air Rescue.&nbsp; You
move a low res image
<br>of a helicopter threw a maze of deadly objects to rescue people, its
not that
<br>great, but again, it's cute.&nbsp; Remember, for $18 your getting 2
great fighter
<br>simulations and a cute arcade rescue game, Microprose has done a very
nice job
<br>of bringing 3 of its classics back for a very affordable price.&nbsp;
You may
<br>consider these old, but they are new to me and many other first time
computer
<br>owners just getting into the thrill of Atari Computers.
