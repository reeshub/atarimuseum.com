<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the past I started a music software
company called Hybrid Arts, Inc.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We helped keep Atari alive for its last
year or more, by convincing</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">them that there was a Music market for
personal computers.&nbsp; Atari was the</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">first computer manufacturer to sell to
the music market.&nbsp; We invited them to share</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a booth with us at NAMM in June 1986,
which they did.&nbsp; That was their first</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">music trade show they (or any other PC
manufacturer) ever participated in.&nbsp; That</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">show resulted in around 30% of their sales,
to the music market, which we had</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">already been selling to for more than
a year prior.&nbsp; At the end of Atari, much more than</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&frac12; of their sales (possibly 100%),
was to the music market, because of the</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">strong MIDI / Music products from our
company and others, Steinberg and many</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">others.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari ST, using
one my "inventions", the ADAP, a professional 16 bit,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">digital audio music and sound design and
editing system, actually became a</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">standard Sound Editing system for about
a year.&nbsp; Todd AO, Glen Glenn had 1</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">in each of their 10 PAP rooms for sound
editorial.&nbsp; Todd AO is the largest</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">sound for film and tv, company in the
world.&nbsp; The ADAP was their sound</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">editing system for more than a year (from
1988 to 1993).&nbsp; The ADAP is still</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">used today on every episode of "The Simpson's"
and "King Of The Hill", by</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Bobby Mackston and his company Mackston
Soundworks, located at Sony Pictures</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Studios.&nbsp; Bobby uses the ADAP with
an Atari ST, because the ADAP does things</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">no other system does and faster.&nbsp;
He uses his Avid AudioVision for most of</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the editing, but for simple quick FX that
his $65k system can't do, like</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">MIDI control of FX, creating stereo 16
bit loops of Bart Simpson and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">etc.,....&nbsp; I think you kind of get
the idea.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAI developed some great
products.&nbsp; HAI was the first to offer MIDI software</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and hardware starting in May 1983, and
first demonstrating a 16 track MIDI</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Recorder and full graphic interface and
programming, using a light pen, for</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the ProPhet 600!&nbsp; This integrated
system of 16 Track MIDI Recorder and GUI</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">P600 programmer, Librarian was in a single
program.&nbsp; We first showed this</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">product in October 1983.&nbsp; MIDI was
not excepted by the MI manufacturers</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">until December 1983.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was the idea person and founder of HAI.&nbsp;
Most and all key products were my</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">idea.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some of this info is at my WebSite, if
you are interested, at----></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do still have several, original, HAI
MIDI interfaces and SMPTE synce boxes</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and the software for the Atari 8bit CPU's
and ST's,... as well as software</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">for all products.&nbsp; I have been wondering
how to sell this.&nbsp; Perhaps you can</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">help me?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How do you advertise now?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Oh well, the point of all of the above
was really to say, HAI started off in</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">my basement, my new business is now in
my upgraded garage,.... I understand</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">how "tiny Businesses" operate and I prefer
it that way.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Soooooooo, thanks for the help and I appreciate
what you, Cathy (and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">others?) at your business are doing.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">PS:&nbsp; If you visit genie.com, you will
find a RoundTable there called,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">MIDI/WorldMusic RoundTable.&nbsp; I started
that for GE / GEnie back in 1988,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">which is also when I started my present
company, WorldMusic, USA.&nbsp; MWR's</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">purpose was to provide data music services
to music makers around the world.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At GEnie you will find soug and sound
files for Atari computers, as well as</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">all other CPU's.&nbsp; My contract with
GE was from 1988 to 1992.&nbsp; GE saw my BBS</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at HAI, which lived from 1983 until 1992
(HAI's end) and GE wanted the same</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">service on GEnie.&nbsp; GE called me,
offered me a contract and I reproduced our</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">MIDIWorldMusic Network for them.</font></center>
