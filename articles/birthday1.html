Things were much simpler back in 1972.  Wall Street went gaga as the Dow climbed over 1000 for the first time. Richard Nixon assured the 
country that no one in the White House had anything to do with the Watergate break-in. And a teenager with facile flipper fingers could 
dream of instant status as a pinball wizard.<P>

Pong changed everything.<P>


<IMG WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=30 SRC="/area/gallery/hisdotline.gif" ALT="Line"><BR>

<B>Well, maybe not everything -- Nixon was sunk with or without it -- but it did put a different spin on American pop culture. The 
stunningly simple ping-pong knockoff not only showed that games could be played on a video screen, but it also set off sparks that 
brought us the personal computer. Not even Nolan Bushnell, King Pong himself, could have thought so boldly. </B><BR>

<IMG WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=30 SRC="/area/gallery/hisdotline.gif" ALT="Line"><P>

Pong was a marriage of Bushnell's two obsessions: computers and games. The son of Mormon parents, he was the kind of kid who liked to 
fix radios and washing machines. Bushnell progressed to engineering student at the University of Utah, where he spent a lot of time 
playing a game called Spacewar on the huge campus computers. This made him ponder the potential of adding computer games to the 
amusement park where he worked summers. (His specialty was luring customers to the ball-toss booth by setting up bottles so the 
wimpiest-looking guy could knock them over, which would keep the macho boys throwing all night.) But the numbers wouldn't work. &quot;When 
you divide 25 cents into an $8 million computer, there ain't no way,&quot; he surmised.<P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=2><B>In the 1970s, Nolan Bushnell became one of the first young geek millionaires</B></FONT><P><BR>

Still a seed had been planted, and when he didn't land his &quot;perfect job&quot; -- research engineer at Disneyland -- Bushnell  
moved to 
Silicon Valley and started the evolution to game god. His breakthrough was to link mini-computers to TV terminals, first in a game 
called Computer Space, a commercial version of the old Spacewar game. It bombed, mainly because it was too complex for buzzed bar 
patrons to master. Bushnell went back to work. Actually he hired a talented, young engineer named Alan Alcorn and asked him to build the 
simplest game possible: a ball that bounced between two paddles. <P>

Long before the technological advances that gave us such wondrous details as spurting blood, Bushnell and Alcorn had little choice but 
to focus on the game's &quot;playability.&quot;  Bushnell remembers spending &quot;tremendous amounts of time trying to do things like 
calibrate how 
much a quarter turn of the control dial resulted in how much movement on the screen.&quot; They added the <I>&quot;pok ... pok ... 
pok&quot;</I> sound effect and reduced the instructions to a six-word mantra: &quot;Avoid missing ball for high score.&quot;<P>

<IMG WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=30 SRC="/area/gallery/hisdotline.gif" ALT="Line"><BR>

<B>Pong was so simple it could be played by a tipsy bar hound with a beer in one hand. Bushnell was thrilled. In November 1972 the first 
Pong game was plugged in at Andy Capp's bar in Sunnyvale, Calif. By week's end, the legend goes, the machine broke down because, the 
repairman discovered, it was jammed with quarters.</B> <BR>

<IMG WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=30 SRC="/area/gallery/hisdotline.gif" ALT="Line"><P>

A few months earlier, with $250 of his own money and a matching investment from partner Ted Dabney, Bushnell had created Pong's parent 
company. He called it Atari, a term used in the Japanese strategy game GO to politely warn an opponent that he is about to be conquered.<P>

True to its name, Atari ruled -- at least at first. Out went pinball machines, in came Pong games. College students became overnight 
addicts. In one week kids at the University of Miami pumped 3,000 quarters into one machine. Within a year Atari sold 8,500 machines.<P>

The company also unleashed a new kind of corporate culture, one that was a haven for laid-back geeks. Engineers worked long hours, 
spurred on by piped-in rock. They held two- and three-day brainstorming sessions, fueled by ample quantities of beer and pot. They 
gathered in  &quot;think tanks,&quot; the company's hot tubs. Many were, in Bushnell's words, &quot;interested in high technology for 
games rather than 
bombs.&quot; One manager almost wasn't hired <I>because</I> he had years of experience at IBM. One who was hired -- Atari's 40th 
employee -- 
was Steve Jobs, who, with Steve Wozniak, went on to found Apple Computer. In fact the two used parts &quot;borrowed&quot; from Atari to 
build their first Apple prototype.<P>

<IMG WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=30 SRC="/area/gallery/hisdotline.gif" ALT="Line"><BR>

<B>Soon, however, competitors caught up. In no time 20 different ping-pong games were on the market. By 1974 Atari was teetering on the 
brink of bankruptcy. It saved itself by rolling out Home Pong, a version of the game that could be played on home TVs.  Even though 
a lot of people had no idea how it worked -- more than one person asked Bushnell how &quot;the people at the TV station know what to do 
when I turn the knob for the game&quot; -- they shelled out $99 to have one.</B><BR>

<IMG WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=30 SRC="/area/gallery/hisdotline.gif" ALT="Line"><P>

By 1976, though, Atari was back in trouble. A new, inexpensive silicon chip revolutionized the game industry, and the number of 
companies in the business soared to 70. Pong became all but obsolete. Atari, desperate for cash to finance the first programmable home 
video game, was bought by Warner for an astounding $28 million. Bushnell stayed on as chairman of the board for two years, but as a 
self-described &quot;bizarre manager&quot; he was a bad fit. He left Atari a rich man, but had to watch as the company, through its Atari 
2600 home video console, became the fastest-growing firm in U.S. history. <P>

It was a short run. The great game-maker Atari couldn't compete in the percolating personal computer market, and in 1983 the video game 
market crashed. Atari lost $538 million. Warner eventually sold the company, and just last summer it merged with a disk drive company. 
The Atari brand name, once a corporate identity second only to Coca-Cola, is barely alive. <P><BR>

<IMG WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=240 SRC="gallery/shouldaphoto3.jpg" ALT="Photo"><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2><B>After Atari, a more prosperous-looking Bushnell gave the world Chuck E. Cheese.</FONT></B><BR> <P>

Bushnell has been on his own roller coaster ride. After Atari he started Chuck E. Cheese Pizza Time Theater, a string of pizza 
parlor/video arcades featuring large talking animals. It soared -- close to 300 outlets and $150 million in sales -- and crashed -- 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy, then was sold off in 1985. Since then Bushnell has created 18 other companies -- selling everything from talking 
teddy bears to automobile navigation systems -- and seen his fortune shrink a bit -- he once owned two Lear jets, four mansions, a fleet 
of luxury cars and a huge yacht called Pong. His latest venture, announced last summer, is Playnet Technologies, which hopes to fill the 
bars of America with devices that will allow people to exchange e-mail, play cross-country games and listen to a vast collection of 
music, all through the Internet. The first ones will show up in Seattle bars this month. <P>

And Pong? Well, it's making something of a comeback. Game collectors love it for its pedigree, game players for its beautiful 
simplicity. It's not Mortal Kombat III, but that's just what some people like about it. Not long ago Pong even made a cameo appearance on 
&quot;The Simpsons.&quot; It was the game of choice of aliens invading Earth.<P>
