<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Phoenix: The Fall &amp; Rise of Video
games</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Rolenta Press, 3rd Edition</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Author: Leonard Herman.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since its first introduction
in 1994, Phoenix has become the Video Game communities official "Road Map"
to the history of video games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book then had a 2nd
edition printing in 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This edition did the previous
edition better with additional past history and expanded coverage of the
current consoles as of its publishing, photo's were included as well, although
too small to truly give justice to content.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phoenix has evolved
yet again into another edition, this time being (and I coin the phrase
"Bigger &amp; Better then before") a newly updated edition with many new
features which not only compliment the existing original content, but enhance
and expand the usefulness of the indispensable resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The book is now in letter sized 8 1/2" X 11" format and includes 388 pages
of history of the video games plus the additional modern console history
of 1997-2000.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new and much applauded addition within
the pages of the book are area's called "Focus-On" sections which detail
specific important events in video game history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cover
gallery of all major US video gaming magazines is included as well as larger
photo's in far greater numbers then in the previous edition.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if this were not
enough for any seasoned video gaming aficionado or for the entry level
beginner just learning about how this magic and marvelous industry got
started, the Foreword of the book is written by none other then the "Father
of Video games" Ralph Baer who's compelling words truly make one sit back
and think about human invention and their imagination to help foster and
create such amazing and wonderful concepts and designs which later would
translate into silicon and wires to bring forth the wonder of wonders....

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone knows and
documents history to its fullest, then that anyone is a someone and that
someone is Leonard Herman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Len.... keep 'em coming,
when's the 4th Edition gonna be ready???&nbsp; :-)</font>
