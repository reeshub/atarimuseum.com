<p>Spy VS Spy III: Artic Antics By Epyx
<p>&nbsp;I thought for a while there that Atari Computers had lost Epyx
as a software
<br>manufacture.&nbsp; Well I was quite wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those two little
Mad Magazine pests are
<br>back again in past III of their madness, this time from way up North.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Again
<br>your faced with the fun Split-Screen and can play against the computer
or an
<br>opponent, the graphics are pretty good, the beginning screen will get
you
<br>immediately laughing.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more laughs you are again equipment
with nasty and
<br>dubious traps and tricks, but time is on your side you've got to complete
your
<br>mission to launch your missile into space and you have to do it before
the big
<br>blizzard, you also have to run back to your igloo, IGLOO?!?!?!?&nbsp;
for some
<br>warmth from the frigid cold.&nbsp; If your looking for some action,
a lot of fun and
<br>laughs, pretty good graphics and a theme song that never quits for
$14 then
<br>this is a the game for you, Epyx did a nice job with this one and the
price is
<br>just right.
<p>MindShadow: An Illustrated Adventure By Activision
<p>&nbsp;I'm not sure if this is new or not, but it was the first time
I had ever seen
<br>it on the store shelf so I thought I'd give it a whirl.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Activision has
<br>released a so-so graphics adventure.&nbsp; I call it so-so because I've been spoiled
<br>with playing The Pawn and now their new release: The Guild of Thieves,
I will
<br>-More-
<br>review Guild as soon as I finish it, or I might not if no one likes
my reviews,
<br>but back to Mindshadow:&nbsp; This game is reminiscent of the Scott
Adams text
<br>adventures, the graphics aren't that great, but they are quick and
detailed
<br>enough to help you spot those "certain little things you MUST know"
to help you
<br>solve the game.&nbsp; What is there to solve?&nbsp; Well you lost your
memory (you
<br>irresponsible fool you!) and you have to find it.&nbsp; Your stuck
on an island and
<br>have to use what's available to you.&nbsp; A nice feature is you can
press your help
<br>button for help, or on the 400/800 computers, type help, and the Condor
(which
<br>can't wait until you drop dead so it can have dinner)&nbsp; will riddle
you a clue,
<br>but watch out!!! you only have 3 chances to use your help.&nbsp; The
game is cute
<br>and does have some snappy come backs and punch lines here and there,
you can
<br>save from 0-6 games and the clues aren't too difficult making this
a great
<br>introductory game for adventuring beginners.&nbsp; The plot to the
story is straight
<br>forward, all you get is loading instructions so there is no help except
for the
<br>clues on the box , Ooopppps, perhaps I shouldn't have said that, but
then
<br>again, if you can't find the clues on the box, you can always take
your chances
<br>with the Condor!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; The price is only $12.95, packaging
is nice, yet simple,
<br>and a bit eerie, I recommend this to a first time adventurer.
