This long sought-after document finally made it into the hands of The Atari
Historical Society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many years the debate on whether
or not there was an actual agreement with Atari &amp; Amiga for the rights
to sell an Atari version of the Amiga Lorraine codenamed within Atari as
"Mickey" has finally been found.&nbsp;&nbsp; Below are several pages of
the agreement that have been OCR'd for easier reading, none of the content
has been edited.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several key sections of the document have
been scanned and images are displayed for additional validity of this contriversial
document.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoy the reading...
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before reading the agreement, a little background info:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On November 21, 1983 Atari
and Amiga signed an agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; This agreement allowed Atari
access to the Amiga computer system in development in exchange for an undisclosed
sum of money from Atari to Amiga for assistance in the development of the
system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay Minor an ex-Atari engineer who was responsible
for the teams that built the Atari 2600 and the Atari 400/800 computers
was in charge of the Amiga "Lorraine" computer system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As part of the agreement Atari would gain access to the Amiga chipset and
design its own version of the Amiga computer codenamed "Mickey" (Atari
at the time was big on Disney with several deals in place, so its assumed
Disney codenames were used), "Minnie" would be a 256K memory card.&nbsp;&nbsp;
As part of the agreement, Atari would sell "Mickey" as a video game system
with no keyboard for 1 year.&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Atari could then sell
a keyboard add-on and sell full blown versions of "Mickey" to the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One ex-Atari Corp. engineer who worked on the Atari TT030 Unix project
told Atari Prototypes &amp; Vaporwares that while occupying a temporary
desk in Atari Corp for a few days, he stumbled across a document detailing
an operating system proposal for a project called "Atari/Amiga: Mickey"
and it listed rough details of a graphics based Unix-like Kernel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Regrettably, he never retained the document, so it has most likely been
lost.&nbsp;&nbsp; However this account sheds yet another tiny light onto
the mystery of what was to be Atari's <I>"Next Generation"</I> computer
system.

<P>LORRAINE is a third generation, low cost, high performance, graphics
and sound system for state of the art videogame and personal computer applications.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system includes three
proprietary, custom ICs controlled by a Motorola 68000 32/16 bit microprocessor.&nbsp;
These chips provide extraordinary color graphics on a Standard TV or on
an RGB color monitor, with resolution and depth to display coin-op quality,
first person video games, cartoons, low resolution photographs, or up to
80 character screens.&nbsp; The sound circuits can duplicate complex waveforms
on each of four channels, matching commercial synthesizers in quality.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The graphics hardware provides
a fully bit-mapped image of up to 320H X 200V pixels each, six bits deep
for a TV or up to 640H X 40OVpixels each four bits deep for an RGB monitor.
Each pixel selects a color value from a 32 entry color palette providing
12 bits of resolution including separate control of up three aspects of
the color signal: Hue, Intensity, and Saturation.&nbsp; The hardware supports
slicing the bit map into two levels of playfield plus background, with
automatic priority overlay of the playfields.&nbsp; In addition, the hardware
supports eight programmable "sprite processors", each providing an arbitrary
number of images 16 pixels wide, arbitrarily tall, and two bits deep which
can be rapidly positioned anywhere on the screen with selectable overlay
priority.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pairs of such processors can be "attached" providing
4 bits of color depth for each sprite image.&nbsp; The resulting screen
image can be scrolled s in both the vertical and horizontal directions.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The color depth of the image
may vary from place to place on the screen. Saving both memory space and
bandwidth in those portions of the image not requiring many simultaneous
colors.&nbsp; In addition, two of the six color planes may be used in the
"hold and control" mode to select between normal indexing of the color
palette or direct setting of one of the color components (Hue, Intensity,
or Saturation) while preserving the other two components from the pixel
immediately to the left.&nbsp; The hold and control mode allows the construction
of very detailed images involving either grey scale shading,&nbsp; pastel
hightlighting, rainbow color effects or any combination of the three.&nbsp;
The Display Instruction Processor (described below) may also be used to
change the color palette on the fly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LORRAINE supports hardware
detection of "collisions" involving either of the playfield images and
each of the 4 sets of attachable sprites.&nbsp; For purposes of collision
detection, each of the playfield "objects" may be further refined, indicating
that only collisions with a given color or excluding a given color are
to be detected. The collision accumulator can be polled and cleared at
any time, allowing the detection of separate collisions in different portions
of the image.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LORRAINE includes a hardware
"Bit-Blit" co-processor, which may be used to create and move several dozen
additional objects in the bit map each frame time, saving and restoring
the background as necessary.&nbsp; The Blitter also provides hardware support
for line drawing and polygon filling functions From a personal computer
perspective, the Blitter provides a generalized hardware capacity for "desk-top"
window management, easily surpassing the software mechanisms underlying
such systems as the Apple LISA (TM).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each LORRAINE audio channel
plays an "audio map" of arbitrary length with frequency and volume set
separately.&nbsp; The audio maps consist of 8 bit "delta" samples describing
the waveform to be produced.&nbsp; Each map array be "played" at a sampeling
rate of up to 30 KHz, or any slower rate selectable with fine resolution.&nbsp;
Left alone, each channel automatically repeats its audio map an arbitrary
number of times, making the generation of sustained tones a trivial task
involving very little memory.&nbsp; Since each map describes an arbitrary
waveforrn a three or four note musical chord can easily be generated by
a single channel. LORRAINE produces stereo sound output, normally by summing
pairs of audio channels.&nbsp; Alternatively one audio channel of each
pair me be configured to modulate the other channel both by amplitude and
frequency.&nbsp; Since the modulating channel may be sampled at a rate
distinct from the normal channel, envelope functions and frequency modulation
synthesis effects are easy to achieve.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frame synchronization, control
register updates, sprite repositioning and automatic color palette and
audio channel updates can all be performed by LORRAINE’s programmable Display
instruction processor.&nbsp; The DIP acts as yet another co-processor,
freeing the 68OOO to execute program logic.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other built-in I/O includes
a keyboard controller, two Atari (tm) compatible game controller with trakball/mouse
logic, a serial port to support a modem, and a mini-floppy disc controller.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The standard configuration
includes 128K bytes of graphics/audio/general purpose RAM and 64K bytes
of resident firmware ROM.&nbsp; LORRAINE may be cartridge extended with
up to 256K bytes of additional ROM or RAM.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, all
68000 data, address and control lines are accessible, allowing LORRAINE
to be integrated with a wide variety of memory, peripheral, and bus-mastering
devices.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LORRAINE includes both high
and low-level support for graphics and audio synthesis.&nbsp; Particular
emphasis has been placed on convenient high-performance access to the hardware
for video game applications.&nbsp; LORRAINE will be packaged with a general
purpose operating system, a BASIC interpreter, a FORTH interpreter, and
several general purpose utilities.

<P><B>Afterthoughts:&nbsp; The Atari 1600XL rumor.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </B>In and around 1984
or so, rumors began to circle about the possibility of an Atari 1600XL
computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the features listed were built in disk
drive, Apple ][e compatibility and even the possibility of having an Intel
8088 daughter processor for IBM compatibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you
carefully read the Features of the LORRAINE it starts to become apparent
that there is a connection to the rumors of the Atari 1600XL and the work
that was being done in-house at Atari in 1983-1984 on the prototype Atari
Amiga codenamed "Mickey".&nbsp;&nbsp; Was Mickey in all truth the very
same rumored Atari 1600XL ?
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently this rumor
has been recently solved.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1998 The Atari Museum&nbsp; recovered nearly 2 dozen Atari Engineering Logbooks, mentioned in 2 of the
logbooks are model # designations for two (2) new Atari computer systems,
one was designated the Atari 1650XLD which would have been 6502 CPU based,
the other was the Atari 1850XLD which would have been based on the Amiga
Lorraine.
