As of January 19, all Video Printed Circuit Board assembly personnel have
been reporting for work at 1320 Bordeaux Drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new building
was finally a reality after several months of construction which had aroused
the curiosity of all employees and a few lunch wagons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving
to the larger facility means that the Stores group no longer has to beg
for floor space from other departments.&nbsp; Work in progress does not
have to be placed in the aisles and people do not have to climb over the
Football Table in order to enter the lunch room.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two new
wave soldering systems are impressive and imposing.&nbsp;&nbsp; And now,
the Shipping and Receiving departments can be distinguished as two separate groups.&nbsp;&nbsp; The big new building is fast becoming home for the
PCB'ers and it promises to be a productive home.</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+2></FONT></FONT>
