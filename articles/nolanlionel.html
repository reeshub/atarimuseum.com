AIMS TO PUT LIONEL ON THE FAST TRACK</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Hey, hey. My, my. Lionel trains will never
die. Has Neil Young</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">added a new verse to his classic song
"Out of the Blue"? Maybe</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">so. Late last month Young purchased Lionel
Trains, the smalltime</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">toymaker, in partnership with Martin Davis,
ex-CEO of Paramount</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">and now head man at Wellspring Associates,
a New York-based</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">investment firm. Strange to find these
two playing in the same</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">sandbox, you say? Maybe not.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The stated purpose of Davis's Wellspring
is to invest in</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">turnaround situations. Davis bought and
sold dozens of companies</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">at Paramount in its days as a conglomerate
called Gulf &amp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Western, so he's no stranger to the game.
And in Lionel he has</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">found a company ripe for righting. Train
sets today are about as</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">hot as hoola hoops. Kids who once pieced
together elaborate</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">track configurations with their dads are
now either twitching</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">away on Nintendo or mesmerized at some
video arcade. Kids want</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">high-tech stuff, and train set technology
has been locked in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">1950s, leaving Lionel helpless, helpless.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Enter Young, a longstanding model-train
freak. On his ranch in</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Northern California he has a stupendous
setup: a</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">4,000-square-foot barn with tracks that
run through extensive</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">live greenery tended by a mist irrigation
system. Young, who</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">loves fiddling with musical equipment,
teamed with Lionel's</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">outgoing CEO, Richard Kughn--who will
retain a minority</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">stake--to upgrade Lionel's electronics.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">And to whom did Young turn for technical
expertise? None other</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">than Silicon Valley heavy Nolan Bushnell,
founder of Atari and</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre.
(Bushnell's kids go to</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">school with Young's.) Young farmed out
his project to Silicon</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Valley engineers Rick Davis and Ron Milner.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Young's team has created a sophisticated
hand-held, wireless</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">remote, called a CAB-1, which uses a computer
chip to move</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">trains, switches, and accessories--and
to control audio, which</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">includes sounds produced by one of Norfolk
&amp; Southern's steam</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">engines, recorded live by Young and his
crew.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Young told MicroTimes, a Northern California
computer magazine:</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">"[Lionel's] technology is now the leading
technology in toys. We</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">have other companies coming to us wanting
to use our technology.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The overall goal is to make an advanced
toy that brings families</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">together in a way videogames don't." Heart
of gold, that guy.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
