<U><FONT SIZE=+2>Relationships between fun and
the computer business</FONT></U>
<P>Author: Bushnell, Nolan
<BR>August, 1996
<P>WHIMSY and fun are often the precursors to powerful tools that are used
later for more serious
<BR>applications. A project at inception might not be useful because of
lack of infrastructure or
<BR>incomplete refinements. The automobile and airplane were considered
toys before they were
<BR>reliable and safe. Now they represent a dominant force in the transportation
business. The
<BR>computer game has filled a similar role in being the incubator for
many innovations that drive the
<BR>usefulness of the computer. This article will describe this role-developing
a set of technologies,
<BR>interaction styles, and social transformation that contributes to the
computer field. We begin with a
<BR>brief historical discussion and then consider some future possibilities.
<P>The following technologies started or at least were popularized with
the computer game business:
<P>* Interactive storylines
<P>* Collaborative computing
<P>* Anthropomorphism
<P>* Widespread use of raster scan monitors
<P>* Sprites
<P>* Real-time graphics
<P>* Graphical user interfaces
<P>* Three-dimensional graphics
<P>* Publicly available computing resources
<P>* Trackballs, joysticks
<P>* Sound feedback
<P>Computer-generated Imagery
<P>We have come far in the relationship between man and computer. To put
it into context, let's
<BR>remember 1971 and the advent of Computer Space (the first video game,
not Pong). Monitors
<BR>were virtually unknown in the computer business other than in some
laboratories with vector
<BR>displays. The interface of choice was punched cards, or paper tape
from mechanical teletype
<BR>machines, or from output of large line printers.
<P>IN the early days of computer games the television was inextricably
linked to the idea of presented
<BR>electronic displays. In fact there was no other source than television
broadcasts for electronically
<BR>displayed imagery. When the computer game industry was being invented
it was much cheaper to
<BR>create computer games using actual televisions from which the tuner
would be striped out rather
<BR>than buying CRTs. The early games used standard production model television
sets that were
<BR>modified. At Atari we generated dumpsters of scrap television tuners
that were stripped out of the
<BR>sets. It was not until the mid-1970s that actual CRT monitors designed
for displaying
<BR>computer-generated data and images were available to the industry.
People in the bars and
<BR>restaurants that were playing the games slowly got used to the thought
that a signal could be
<BR>generated locally (in the beginning it was common for people to ask
how the TV station knew
<BR>what the knobs on the machine were doing) since in most minds the TV
and the TV station were
<BR>totally linked. Later, that concept was further enhanced with the local
modulator that allowed the
<BR>home game to be connected to the living room television set. Could
the Apple II be as successful if
<BR>it had been bundled with its own expensive monitor?
<P>Computers in the Entertainment Field
<P>The game industry, like the business industry, moved from mechanical
to electronics to computers.
<BR>The early coin-operated video games were not really computers at all,
but were state machines
<BR>that used TTL logic and counters. Remember that the first microprocessor
was not yet invented in
<BR>1971. The calculations that were necessary to play a game were not
possible at an acceptable
<BR>price at that time. It seems quaint now, but there was actually a four-bit
TTL counter for every
<BR>scoring digit that appeared on the screen.
<P>The Introduction of Scenario and Storyline
<P>Video games further conditioned players in real-time sequence manipulation
and other activities
<BR>that had only before been touched on in sports. The game had an ability
to simplify and make
<BR>repeatable processes and skills that trained a whole generation into
seeking and finding hidden
<BR>goals, processes, and systems.
<P>The rise of Nintendo and the Japanization of the game business that
occurred in the late 1980s
<BR>created perhaps the most extensive import of foreign culture that has
happened in America other
<BR>than through immigration. A large portion of the games we play are
scripted, designed, and
<BR>authored in the orient. It is generally viewed as a national strength
that the U.S. exports its culture
<BR>to the world through its movie and television production capabilities.
The converse fact is that
<BR>many distinctly Asian concepts have entered the world culture through
video games (the Ninja
<BR>Turtles and other distinctive oriental fighting games, for example).
The video-game business
<BR>affected many facets of the computer revolution, many of which have
changed the basics of
<BR>human-computer relationships. They will also continue to change other
aspects as networks
<BR>become an increasing part of game play.
<P>The Game Industry Invented User Interfaces
<P>Many user interfaces were developed for the game business. The user
interface demands of games
<BR>are undeniable. From the leisure/entertainment definition games must
be easy to interact with and
<BR>learn. Particularly in the coin-operated sector, which was unprotected
from the crutch of training or
<BR>user manuals, it was simply a fact that a confusing user interface
failed to attract enough quarters
<BR>from customers for monetary success, and that good user communication
resulted in more income
<BR>for the machine. Controls and placement of controls further enhanced
the body of knowledge of
<BR>how people and their machines interact.
<P>The use of a non-keyboard interface was perfected in the game industry.
The dependence on
<BR>direct manipulation of on-screen programming, and the use of anthropomorphic
characters to
<BR>create a sense of relationship started in the game industry. Steve
Mayer talked about sprites in the
<BR>early 1970s as a way to create cheap images-we called them stamps.
In the 1970s memory was
<BR>very expensive (both ROM and RAM) so anything that allowed you to save
bits was a good idea.
<P>The microworld in which users immersed themselves in an "alternative
reality" was developed into
<BR>an art form in the game industry. Who can forget the experience in
"Colossal Cave" on the early
<BR>game machines?
<P>Technology Expectations Created by the Game Industry
<P>Technology expectations have driven many systems. Would people have
embraced automatic
<BR>teller machines as quickly without prior knowledge of games' touch
screens or buttons that affect
<BR>outcomes on the screen? Computer-generated images have also been made
commonplace in the
<BR>everyday world. Today it seems a normal part of the entertainment world
to see characters and
<BR>whole worlds that started in games. Software and hardware innovation
structures such as sprites,
<BR>blitter objects, and certain aspects of direct memory access were all
created because of the intense
<BR>graphics requirements for games. Many new forms of games were made
possible--goal-directed
<BR>behavior has really been enabled in powerful ways. Is it possible that
one must know the laws of
<BR>physics in order to "save the princess"? Perhaps this metaphor holds
the keys for many new
<BR>training, business, and communication structures.
<P>The Game Industry Created the Consumer Computer Industry
<P>Economics of scale can be a major factor in the diffusion of a technology
into a society. The game
<BR>business used so much silicon that it funded huge amounts of foundry
building and process
<BR>refinements. Atari was the largest consumer of N-channel LSI for most
of the 1970s and early
<BR>1980s. Its consumption of ROM and RAM created powerful incentives for
manufacturers to
<BR>produce memory chips in previously unheard-of quantities and prices.
Without the lower prices
<BR>these high volumes supported, the personal computer would have been
priced several thousand
<BR>dollars more per unit. Monitors would have been significantly more
costly without the increased
<BR>volume of the game business.
<P>The Computer Game Industry's Anti-educational Underbelly
<P>The social dynamics of games have been not all positive. Games by their
nature represent
<BR>challenge and conflict. The rules of sports and war all have winners
and losers. The very existence
<BR>of a score implies challenge. The concept of win-win is a much more
difficult concept of
<BR>communication. The increasing appetite for violence in movies and television
is perhaps a result of
<BR>graphic, detailed conflict from the game-playing experiences that each
child has. Can some of the
<BR>more useful concepts of life such as cooperation, charity, and shared
goals be as important in
<BR>future games as conflict? It is probably extremely difficult but worth
a try.
<P>Where Will the Computer Game Industry Take Us?
<P>As with any genera, the game industry is not static; possibly more than
any other genera, it
<BR>contributes to and provides momentum for the technology of the future.
We need to think of where
<BR>this can take us in social interaction, entertainment, education, and
in our work.
<P>Any discipline that has grown to be as big a part of our lives as software
needs to develop
<BR>categories to help in the understanding as well as the creation of
the products. Let's consider a
<BR>classification system for software that focuses on the environment
of the user and the way a person
<BR>reacts with the software.
<P>Deskware. We are aware of this class since it tends to be the dominant
software. It is meant to be
<BR>viewed approximately from 18 inches away and is manipulated with a
keyboard and pointing
<BR>device. It is expected that one can read large amounts of text if necessary
and modify text as well
<BR>as manipulate small objects on the screen. This medium presupposes
a one-on-one relationship of
<BR>human to computer. It also presupposes a hard flat surface upon which
to place and use the
<BR>control devices.
<P>Couchware. This is what is put on the television set in the family room
and will become more
<BR>important as the television becomes a two-way communication device.
It is meant to be viewed
<BR>from eight feet away, plus or minus four feet. The control for couchware
is always supposed to be
<BR>hand-held in free space and can be wired or remote. The best examples
are videogame controllers
<BR>or wireless remote control units. I believe the dominant pointing device
for couchware will be much
<BR>like today's remote control with some new functions. Couchware cannot
presuppose a great deal
<BR>of reading or text manipulation and small object control is out of
the question. Scrolling and
<BR>"detent" access to buttons will dominate.
<P>Kitchenware. This piece of software is in fact the nerve center of the
family. It is viewed from 18
<BR>inches but it is presumed the user is standing and the display screen
is mounted on the wall. The
<BR>user interface is in all cases a touch screen. The information is all
button-accessed, and has to be
<BR>instantaneous and very simple. This software has to actually be used
by family members as young
<BR>as four years old, even if a chair must be used to reach the device.
<P>Bedroomware and Bathroomware are very close in function and form factor
to kitchenware, the
<BR>focus being scheduling and communications. The homecontrol features
are all accessible and for
<BR>bathroomware games are also very important. There are those that presuppose
the bedroom has a
<BR>TV and that modified couchware is the operative mode. Location certitude
is a necessary feature
<BR>of all these and a remote control that has any kind of pointing feature
is sure to lack that certainty
<BR>of location.
<P>Autoware is very different if thinking is based on one's assumptions
about its use for the driver or
<BR>passenger. In fact many believe there should be no visual software
for automobile drivers. I believe
<BR>that for the driver the visual interface has been in place for years,
just not in a computer GUI
<BR>mode. Clearly the dashboard and instrument cluster should have been
using computer screens
<BR>years ago-I can remember looking at the cost-benefit tradeoffs for
electronic dashboards 10 years
<BR>ago and being frustrated because of the unwillingness of the automobile
manufacturers to change.
<BR>We did the analysis for the automobile navigation company ETAK and
hoped we would be in the
<BR>software business selling maps and travel guides to the Autoware interface
that was in all new cars.
<P>Storeware is the stuff of the electronic checkout counters and product
information material. Some
<BR>of its unique features are language flexibility and extremely high
graphic content. Touch-screen
<BR>input and ruggedized construction of other controls are also presumed.
<P>Bankware. We have all seen the terrible job that the automatic teller
machines have done in
<BR>making the process of bank transactions about following instructions
to press keys. Clearly new
<BR>software is needed.
<P>Gameware. The coin-operated video game and the user interface was in
some ways the first user
<BR>interface used by ordinary people. We learned many things that I think
are true today more than
<BR>ever in all forms of software. One: People will not and hate to read
instructions. Two: If people
<BR>cannot get up the learning curve in 15 seconds they will not spend
the second quarter. Three: If
<BR>you must give instructions make them short, direct, and in as large
a font as possible.
<P>With the game Pong over 20 years ago the instructions we used were very
simple-there are those
<BR>that think they could be a metaphor for life. The guidelines for use
were: Insert Quarter.
<P>Ball Will Serve Automatically.
<P>Avoid Missing Ball for High Score.
<P>Is there a piece of game software that when played well will create
a business plan for the player?
<BR>Is there a game that trains a sales force on a newly released product?
Are there games that can
<BR>become the answer to declining scores and capabilities of the nation's
school children?
<BR>Goal-directed software (games) may have many uses that are just beginning
to be understood and
<BR>that may be the key to surviving in the explosive area of communication
requirements in which an
<BR>individual in an increasingly complex world is swimming in a sea of
undigested information.
<P>Electronic Pets
<P>Several years ago I started a company to build and market electronic
pets. It was and still is my
<BR>feeling that a good electronic pet properly designed would be significantly
better than the flesh and
<BR>blood kind. The people I present this idea to are almost uniformly
horrified at the thought that a
<BR>mechanical device could replace Rover, Mittens, or Spot.
<P>Even when I describe releasing them from the obligatory trip to the
pound it doesn't seem to help.
<BR>They wonder how could I create the cold wet nose. I reply that Mattel
has marketed slime for
<BR>years and that small ultrasonic refrigeration works great and is very
cheap. Then they ask if the pet
<BR>will come when called: of course, and with much better reliability
than before.
<P>Others think the real bond between owner and pet comes from care and
feeding, creating a feeling
<BR>that it is dependent. To which I respond that it is a simple thing
to replace the automatic charging
<BR>system with one in which the batteries are recharged in a charger and
manually placed in the pet
<BR>dish. The pet loads the battery aboard while discharging another. When
the first bank is totally
<BR>discharged it drops the battery on the carpet wherever it happens to
be. The battery can then be
<BR>picked up with the super-duper battery scooper, just like now. Signs
would appear in New York
<BR>City to battery curb your pet or risk receiving a ticket.
<P>What about the safety aspects of a good guard dog? The sensor technology
allows the robotic pet
<BR>to sense sounds at very low levels, and equipped with the Pit Bull
JawsTM option can be quite
<BR>fearsome to intruders. An additional advantage is the lack of distraction
from sides of beef or other
<BR>dogs in heat. This pet is on the job until a password is heard.
<P>The real reason for an electronic pet is for the things the pet can
do that the normal flesh and blood
<BR>(bio types) cannot do. Suppose a flight attendant for an airline wants
to have a pet. It is very
<BR>difficult for that person to have one, the schedule is erratic and
the long stretches away from home
<BR>make a pet for a single person almost impossible. With an electronic
version, the pet can stand
<BR>guard for weeks at a time. Barking at any significant sound, making
periodic inspections of the
<BR>other rooms to check for fire or a leaky faucet. If anything is detected,
the pet can call the
<BR>appropriate agency with the location and nature of the problem.
<P>Upon return the pet, in this case Max, greets the master by saying "Hi,
Barbara, have I ever
<BR>missed you! Have you had a hard trip?" or other such caring and dependent
message. To show
<BR>excitement, the mechanical animal will run around in small circles
making short, high-pitched
<BR>beeping sounds.
<P>The real fun with an electronic pet comes with the games. The easy games
are the
<BR>question-and-answer games. These are structured with the pet asking
the questions and the person
<BR>answering with yes or no. There are many scoring variations on this
basic concept. The classic
<BR>hide-and-seek for small children is a lot of fun. Because the pet has
very accurate sensing
<BR>mechanisms, there can be many games based on monitoring the motion
and location of the players
<BR>by the pet. In the childhood game of red light/green light the players
can attempt to sneak up on the
<BR>pet as long as the pet is green (if there are no lights there can be
audible sounds). As soon as the
<BR>light turns red, the player must freeze until the light turns green
again. The player that moves while
<BR>the red light is on is sent back to the beginning to start all over.
The idea is to trade off the slow
<BR>and steady approach to game playing since the timid player is not likely
to be moving if they move
<BR>little during any green cycle.
<P>Other games such as 'Jump on the Monster" where the pet spins around
and then declares that
<BR>there is an invisible monster six feet in front of him. The player
then tries to estimate how far six feet
<BR>is and jump there as fast as possible. If the player is too slow or
in the wrong place the monster
<BR>moves to another place and no score for jumping on it is given. A new
form of musical chairs in
<BR>which there are arbitrary "chairs" defined on the floor. The pet names
a person and they must
<BR>move to the new place on the floor. The pet keeps track of who is sitting
where and starts calling
<BR>out names and locations that get more and more confusing until there
are conflicting orders and the
<BR>game stops. There will be at least one person in the wrong spot.
<P>The pet can be programmed to speak and understand only a foreign language
and act as a great
<BR>tutor. The nightly bedtime story for the kids will quickly become part
of the family ritual. All the
<BR>neat things that the pet can do will make the robotic pet an important
part of our future.
<P>The electronic pet's territory might comprise an electronically controlled
house, offering many
<BR>possibilities for interactivity and cooperative efforts between the
two.
<P>Playing Games With Your House
<P>Home control has many definitions. My definition is a house in which
all the electrical outlets,
<BR>appliances, and lights have an address and are controlled by computer
intelligence. Each room has
<BR>a sensor pod and stereo speakers. It can also have light switches at
any point attached to any
<BR>surface with double-backed tape. The switches work with the control
computer to control a
<BR>specific function, though in most cases they are not necessary. The
sensor pods have infrared
<BR>motion detectors, microphones, light sensors, and temperature detectors.
<P>Using the power of the computer, the house soon learns that based on
the time and other factors it
<BR>turns on the lights in rooms that people are in and turns out the lights
in rooms that are empty. It
<BR>listens for commands and knows who the person in the room is through
"signature characteristics"
<BR>so that when the phone rings, the house simply asks the specific person
if the call should be
<BR>answered. The call then becomes a speaker phone conversation unless
the handset in the room is
<BR>lifted. These are just some of the interesting thing smart houses can
do, along with all sorts of
<BR>interesting energy management tasks.
<P>PLAYING games with your house is fun. Some of the simple games are based
on the fact that the
<BR>house knows where you are. It can choose a location in the house at
random and then give you
<BR>"colder" or "warmer" hints to guide you to the right spot, the score
being higher when the fewest
<BR>hints are needed to find the spot. The reverse game is one in which
the house agrees to cover its
<BR>collective eyes while you hide. The house then prompts you to respond
and only listens with its
<BR>stereo microphones in one room. The house's score is based on the smallest
number of guesses it
<BR>takes to find you (provided the house doesn't cheat).
<P>Another large class of games is word games that ask a series of yes
or no questions about all sorts
<BR>of things. In the early stages the house will probably have a somewhat
limited speaker-independent
<BR>vocabulary. Thus the yes/no restriction, which is removed in later
years as the house's vocabulary
<BR>expands.
<P>The house can be a great partier. Think of dancing to music that moves
from room to room. It can
<BR>pull the party around the house in a rock-and-roll samba line and add
an additional dimension. The
<BR>house as a musical instrument concept is also fun. The house could
play a note whose pitch is a
<BR>function of the right/left position of the musician in the room and
the amplitude a function of the
<BR>forward/back position in the room. Another algorithm could be for a
clap to start a note and the
<BR>forward/back position be the duration of the note. People could be
jamming in different rooms
<BR>with their voices being blended and augmented. Of course, the whole
thing can be recorded for
<BR>later playback once all the musicians have had a rest. Who knows, it
may be the aerobics of the
<BR>future.
<P>If you haven't had a murder mystery dinner party yet, I highly recommend
it. There are also several
<BR>interactive plays that have been produced. The best one, Tamara, played
in New York several
<BR>years ago. The idea is that all the people at the party are characters
in a story. Someone is
<BR>murdered and through questions and answers clues are learned about
the people (characters) that
<BR>lead to a solution. It is a great time and having the house be the
narrator and host would add a
<BR>great deal to the evening. With the house's ability to add sound effects,
to adapt the scripts and to
<BR>direct the group to other rooms, the implications are marvelous.
<P>For kids, the house can be a friend with counting games and imaginary
friends that talk to the child
<BR>but can't be seen. The house can be used as a storyteller and a watcher
to make sure the child
<BR>keeps away from the front door or workshop. The house becomes not just
an inanimate container
<BR>but an active and interesting member of the family: reminding, assuring,
entertaining, and playing
<BR>with the family.
<P>The Virtual Room
<P>The virtual room is an old concept that is almost reality, meaning that
it is possible to build one if
<BR>you have enough money. The idea is to have a room that is totally changeable.
All the walls would
<BR>be active flatscreen panels that would be operated by computer. The
first ideas were for video
<BR>"wallpaper" in which the color and/or pattern could be changed to match
the mood. With
<BR>multimedia, the thought of being able to create the feeling of being
beside a brook in Yosemite, on
<BR>the seashore of Hawaii, on the streets of Manhattan, on the top of
Mt. Everest, on the center grass
<BR>of the Kentucky Derby, or floating in space somewhere between the earth
and moon becomes
<BR>possible.
<P>The flat screen panels are much too costly, but I calculate that by
using frosted plexiglass on the
<BR>ceiling and four walls and using some of the very good liquid crystal
projectors that are made by
<BR>Sharp and Panasonic, the technology for the room could be had for under
$20,000. This may
<BR>sound like a lot, and it is, but in the world of private interior decorators,
it would be rated on the
<BR>low end of the scale. Like with so many other things, the rich will
pay for the low-volume
<BR>engineering for things that in the future become available to everyone.
<P>Imagine the hardware is installed by the end of the year in 10,000 homes.
Where does the
<BR>software come from? How much does it cost? Can there be a business
selling it? If you want to be
<BR>surrounded by stationary objects or graphics, the price could be very
low, but if the idea is to have
<BR>surround sound and motion effects, the price could be quite high and
complicated to produce.
<P>You can also add smell quite cheaply by buying a multichambered smell
creator. It consists of
<BR>individual chambers that contain aroma pellets that are used in the
amusement industry. On
<BR>computer command, a small quantity of air is passed over the pellet
and that air is then injected
<BR>into the air conditioning ducts.
<P>Disney, with its circlerama technology, found that simultaneously filming
in 360 degrees
<BR>represented an interesting challenge. Where does the cameraman stand?
They solved the problem
<BR>by clustering the cameras and shooting down with mirrors. They often
shot with the pod being
<BR>suspended from a helicopter or crane. At other times the unit, which
is rather ungainly, was
<BR>mounted on a truck and the people running it were located below. The
software for the virtual
<BR>room will not have that advantage. Who knows, perhaps we have stumbled
onto the first real
<BR>postulate of the virtual world. How does one record (observe) the world
without affecting it?
<BR>Sounds a little like a non-subatomic version of Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle, which states that
<BR>you cannot observe any phenomenon without affecting it.
<P>The proper virtual room should have a small room next to it to store
the different furniture or props
<BR>that may be needed to round out and complete the experience. The couch
on which one would
<BR>like to fly through space is very different than the one used to view
the sunset over the Golden
<BR>Gate Bridge.
<P>While the virtual room as a living space is interesting and visionary,
the virtual room in interactive
<BR>mode comes alive with possibilities. Some of the best work in this
area has been done by Myron
<BR>Krueger and chronicled in his book Artificial Reality. I highly recommend
this book: it offers some
<BR>fascinating ways to combine people images and sensors. To give you
an idea of how
<BR>forward-thinking he was, his work was done nearly 15 years ago using
mainframe computers and
<BR>links to process the sensor data and create some of the images in wireframe.
The whole thing
<BR>could be run now on a simple 486-based machine but I always respect
the real pioneers.
<P>Imagine there are sensors in the room that detect your position in the
room. Suppose further they
<BR>can tell where your head is. By modifying the images based on personal
location some interesting
<BR>possibilities begin to unfold. As an example, the floor is considered
solid as you look down but as
<BR>you walk closer to the edge of the room, the floor occludes less of
the view below. Like walking
<BR>to the window in a skyscraper, you can only see the street below if
you look down when you are
<BR>next to the window. If you ever want to believe you are standing on
a platform in free space, just
<BR>go into a virtual room that has image modification based on head position.
This exceeds the
<BR>perception in the best eye phone VR system I have seen to date.
<P>Now let's fly to the room (platform) from the couch and, using joystick
and computers, have a
<BR>great shared experience. Your associates can be part of the fun by
being tailgunners, etc. Or if it's
<BR>driving the hook-and-ladder fire engine through the streets of Manhattan
(I've always wanted to
<BR>drive the back wheels), two steering wheels can be used.
<P>Of course mazes and dungeons and dragons are a "must have" for the room
with the specter of the
<BR>huge malevolent dragon actually standing 30 feet above you. It might
really be scary. Interactive
<BR>party games can be played in which several people enter the room, each
person is sensed and
<BR>placed as an icon on one of the walls. The computer then creates the
problem or contest. First,
<BR>each person needs to see how to control his or her character. It can
be straight translation of
<BR>position on the floor to position on the screen. If you walk forward,
your icon moves up. If you
<BR>walk to the right, your icon moves to the right. But it may be more
complex such as your location
<BR>being the sum of your motion and someone else's or the difference.
Krueger found that very
<BR>complex interactions of groups can be created and solved by groups
in this type of facility.
<P>It may happen that the virtual room at the turn of the century may be
to parties what the hot tub
<BR>was in the 1970s but no matter what, it will be a great place to just
hang out. 3
