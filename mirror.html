												<font size="5" face="Arial">The original proprietor of The Atari Museum,
													the
													hugely
													respected computing historian Curt Vendel, sadly unexpectedly <a
														href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gaming-historian-curt-vendel-dies-at-53"
														target="_blank">passed away aged 53 on August 30th 2020</a>.
													This website became
													inaccessible around a year later when its hosting expired.
													<br>
													<br>
													Having personally used this website and its predecessor
													atari-history.com for research
													over the years, it seemed such a shame for Curt's life's work to not
													be indexed and
													available on
													the wider web, so I took it upon myself to mirror it here in as
													complete a form
													as I could piece together. This mirror is based upon <a
														href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210716141211/http://www.atarimuseum.com/"
														target="_blank">the Wayback Machine's 2021-07-16 14:12 crawl of
														atarimuseum.com</a>, the last available before it went offline.
													<br>
													<br>I have made
													no changes to the content or layout, only manually checking every
													page and fixing broken
													links and images where I find them - and adding this explanatory
													page. You can see the reconstruction
													and cleanup process in the GitHub repo <a
														href="https://github.com/reeshub/atarimuseum.com">here</a>.<br>
													<br>
													As a fellow fan of Atari history, my only motivation in making this
													mirror available
													is to make his work as accessible as possible in its original form,
													and I hope it is
													received by the community as intended. While I have no personal
													connection to Curt, he was
													a hero and inspiration of mine and we had some good chats on
													Facebook over the years,
													so I like to think that he would approve. May he Rest In Peace
													knowing that his efforts were not in vain.

													As explained in the video, this website now has Karl Morris's
													blessing as the official mirror. Karl was Curt's cofounder and
													partner in the Atari Historical Society. I've also been working on
													reconstructing a mirror of the sister site to this one - Karl's
													excellent

													although it's still missing a few pieces.
