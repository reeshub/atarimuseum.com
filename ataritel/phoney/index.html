<font face="Arial"><b>&nbsp;</b>In 1876 Alexander Graham Bell would make the 
historic statement, </font><span style="font-family: Arial">“</span><font face="Arial">Watson, 
come here. I need you.</font><span style="font-family: Arial">”</span><font face="Arial">&nbsp; 
His assistant, Watson would hear the words come through his prototype telephone 
speaker </font><span style="font-family: Arial">–</span><font face="Arial"> he 
then came into the room where Bell had just spoken into his prototype telephone 
microphone.&nbsp; Watson would repeat those words back to Bell and the birth of the 
telephone would take place.&nbsp; Within only two years, the imagination of George du 
Maurier would sketch a concept of a man sitting, having a conversation with a 
woman seen on a projection screen who was also holding a phone and they are 
having a visual conversation.&nbsp; By 1910, a French postcard depicting very much 
the same scene was created stating that this was what the telephone would be in 
the year 2000.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>

<font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;By the late 1920</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">s 
Bell Laboratories is researching video telephone technologies, and in a scene 
from the 1927 movie </font><span style="font-family: Arial">‘</span><font face="Arial">Metropolis</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial"> 
there is a scene of two men talking on huge wall sized telephone system with a 
small video screen so they could see each other while talking through standard 
telephone handsets.&nbsp; And by 1956, Bell Laboratories would set up a demonstration 
deployment of its </font><span style="font-family: Arial">‘</span><font face="Arial">Picture-Phone</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial"> 
between Los Angeles and New York.&nbsp;&nbsp; The system actually required three dedicated 
specialized phone lines.&nbsp; One line each for video to New York, and one to Los 
Angeles.&nbsp; A third line for the audio conversation was then required and all of 
these dedicate lines had to be synced together across the telephone carrier</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">s 
network.&nbsp; The big public awareness of videophones would come at the 1964 World</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">s 
Faire in New York.&nbsp; Demonstrations between New York and Washington DC were 
shown.&nbsp; Just as the earlier picture-phone prototypes required three special 
dedicated lines, the 1964 system did as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bell Labs attempted several 
commercial installations of the picture-phone networks into New York, Washington 
DC and Chicago.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of up to $27 per minute for a call would lead to the 
product</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">s 
failure.&nbsp; Despite the real world commercial failure of the picture-phone due to 
its specialized infrastructure needs and its overly expensive cost, the public 
became captivated by the idea of one day being able to have actual video phone 
calls.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would reach new heights as the futuristic cartoon show </font>
<span style="font-family: Arial">‘</span><font face="Arial">The Jetson</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">s</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">

every episode.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="Body1" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;In 1969, Stanley Kubrick</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">s 
science fiction fantasy </font><span style="font-family: Arial">‘</span><font face="Arial">2001: 
A Space Odyssey</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial"> 
would also show a very realistic scene of a father placing a video phone call to 
his daughter on what the movie would depict as being an AT&amp;T public payphone in 
the future.&nbsp; This would be a long distance call as the father would be onboard 
an orbiting space station calling his daughter to wish her a happy birthday and 
a goodnight back on Earth.&nbsp; AT&amp;T with its research and marketing muscle as well 
as large coffers of financial resources to tap into would not give up this 
uphill battle to make videophones a commercially viable enterprise.&nbsp; In 1970 
AT&amp;T would try to do this once again.&nbsp; In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, it would 
deploy its Picturephone II system and network.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as quickly, it would 
silently admit defeat and shut it down.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bell telephone giant would step 
back and not make another attempt for almost 15 more years.&nbsp; </font></p>

<font face="Arial">&nbsp;Meanwhile in the foothills of the California Sierra 
Mountains, back in the Grass Valley Research and Development Lab, in 1976 the 
Cyan engineering team begins work on a project called </font>
<span style="font-family: Arial">‘</span><font face="Arial"><i>Phoney</i>.</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">&nbsp; 
It</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">s a 
remarkable design for video transmission technology.&nbsp; </font>
<span style="font-family: Arial">“</span><font face="Arial">Bear in mind that we 
did not have DSP chips and a lot of cheap memory available, so it was a 
challenge to do anything practical,</font><span style="font-family: Arial">”</span><font face="Arial"> 
recalls Larry Emmons.&nbsp; The concept design and ideas are shown to Nolan Bushnell 
and Joe Keenan.&nbsp; Joe came up with the idea that this could be an 
entertainment-based device, and to perhaps try to design a toy around the 
technology and not build something for business or commercial use.</font><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial">
</font></p>
<p class="Body1" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;So Larry Emmons, Dave Stokes and Michael Cooper-Hart begin 
work on building a simulation prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp; While Larry and Dave worked on the 
engineering side, Michael became the Project Concept Manager.&nbsp; He was hired to 
do project management and industrial design and to help get projects 
(specifically the video project) funded and into production. The video project 
needed a kick start and funding.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="Body1" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;When he first saw the project in the lab, it was a small 16 
x 16 image on a 19-inch open frame monitor.&nbsp; He knew what was needed was a 
demonstration prototype and a funding proposal.</font><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial"> 
A demonstration prototype system would be built, consisting of two desktop base 
units that would each be wired across the lab into a card cage system holding 
all of the electronics.&nbsp; Since this would be the very early stages of product 
development, its physical size and the need to be able to easily pull out a 
section to work on, made it a large system requiring a card cage box for all of 
the major electronic components to reside in.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="Body1" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;The initial prototype didn't actually use a telephone line 
but instead just a dedicated wiring system that ran from one office on one side 
of the lab floor to another office way on the other side of the lab floor.&nbsp; 
However, to make sure that eventually the product could be compatible with the 
standard telephone line systems of the day, it was restricted to data rates and 
capabilities that were possible at the time</font><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial">(modeling 
capabilities after fax machines which were just out and very were expensive).</font><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial">
</font></p>
<p class="Body1" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;Larry Emmons and the Cyan team came up with this idea that 
telephone conversations had some degree of down time with pauses between words 
being spoken where they might be able to insert picture data.</font><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial"> 
Their test vehicle worked quite well, and the limited resolution photos were 
first sent from one end of the link until they were complete and then the 
process was reversed.</font><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial"> 
With this setup, voice had priority over the picture, and the remote photo would 
be received line by line during lapses in audio.</font><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial">
</font></p>
<p class="Body1" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;One afternoon, Nolan and company travelled to Grass 
Valley for a demonstration of the picture phone and to check the status on other 
projects (which was a trip they made periodically for this purpose).</font><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial"> 
When it came time to demonstrate the phone, they had one part of it set up in 
the main office, and the second part in a back lab.</font><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial"> 
Everyone played with it for awhile and had a good time testing it out.&nbsp; Finally 
with everyone retiring to the main office, Nolan had abruptly disappeared.</font><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial"> 
The demo was still active with photos still being exchanged on the device when 
Lanny Netz noticed a remotely troubling, but disturbingly familiar object coming 
in on the video feed. &nbsp;Larry tried to divert everyone</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">s 
attention from the screen, getting everyone talking while he tried to block the 
incoming image by using up all of the priority data transfer.&nbsp; However, the 
inevitable occurred. The image would fully process onto the screen for all in 
the front office to see</font><span style="font-family: Arial">…</span><font face="Arial"> 
You guessed it!&nbsp; Nolan had retired to the back room for the sole purpose of 
mooning the picture phone audience!&nbsp; Not quite the same historic reverence as 
the famous Bell &amp; Watson </font><span style="font-family: Arial">‘</span><font face="Arial">Come 
Here!</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial"> moment 
in telephone history, but certainly a memorable, landmark (and classic </font>
<span style="font-family: Arial">‘</span><font face="Arial">Atari-style</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">) 
moment for all who were present for this graphic </font>

<p class="Body1" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;After the demonstration, Ron Milner (though not involved in 
the project) needed a power supply to use elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; The demonstration system 
was built into a cage card that had a perfect power supply that he could use.&nbsp; 
Ron proceeded to disconnect the power supply to remove it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknowingly he let 
the 110v hot wire which was still live touch the 5v line on the card cage.&nbsp; Each 
of the cards proceeded, almost in a queued fireworks sequence to spark, smoke 
and burn out.&nbsp; </font><span style="font-family: Arial">“</span><font face="Arial">It 
was quite a fireworks show.&nbsp; Luckily it didn</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">t 
burn the lab down or set off the sprinkler system,</font><span style="font-family: Arial">”</span><font face="Arial"> 
recalls Ron Milner.&nbsp; As for courting funding from Atari for a project such as 
this, Michael became</font><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial">so 
successful</font><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial">in 
this process that he gained the nickname Michael &quot;Corporate-Hart&quot; of which he 
was actually proud to hold the title of.&nbsp; Someone had to help get these great 
ideas funded and into production and Michael would become the man behind the 
curtain whose job it was to glorify the great work being done by Cyan.</font></p>

division called </font><span style="font-family: Arial">‘</span><font face="Arial"><b>Ataritel</b>.</font><span style="font-family: Arial">’</span><font face="Arial">&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;While the video 
phone system from Grass Valley would remain a completely separate project, Steve 
Bristow saw it as a logical compliment to the work his new R&amp;D team would pursue 
in developing a new line of telephone systems which would provide unique 
advanced features that had never before been available in telephone systems.&nbsp; 
Hence, Atari’s new ‘Project Falcon’ was born.</span></p>
