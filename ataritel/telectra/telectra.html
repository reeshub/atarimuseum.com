            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">It all started with a meeting at Warner
            Communications with Steven Bristow. He came to demonstrate an idea
            that he and fellow Atari engineers had been tinkering with. He was
            very interested in the technology being used in Home Intercom called
            Powerline Communication Intercoms.&nbsp; These intercom
            systems would plug into the power outlets in
            a house which allowed two people to be able to talk to one another
            through the home electrical wiring. Steve explained to the Board
            that this type of technology could be the basis for a whole new line
            of products for Atari outside of its Entertainment focus.&nbsp; That
            telephones and home controllers could be created to allow people to
            be able to have phones through out their homes to receive and place
            calls, to be able to use them as intercoms, room monitors and more.
            Additional features such as being able to control power modules to
            turn lights on and off as well as other devices could also be
            created.</font></p>
      
            <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Warner Board fully supported this new idea to
            the point where they decided Atari should have a new Division that
            these technologies would be developed and sold under called Ataritel.
            So Steve return to California and began to assembled his team and go
            to work...</font></p>
