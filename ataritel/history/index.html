      <p align="center">Alexander Graham Bell made the historic statement 
      “Watson, come here. I</p>
      <p align="center">need you,” in 1876. His assistant, Watson would hear the 
      words come through his</p>
      <p align="center">prototype telephone speaker, causing him to come into 
      the room where Bell had just</p>
      <p align="center">spoken into his prototype telephone microphone - the 
      birth of the telephone had</p>
      <p align="center">taken place.  </p>

      <p align="center">Within only two years, the imagination of 
      George du Maurier would</p>
      <p align="center">evolve the concept with a sketch of a man sitting, 
      having a conversation with a woman</p>
      <p align="center">seen on a projection screen who was also holding a phone 
      and they are having a</p>
      <p align="center">visual conversation. By 1910, a French postcard 
      depicting very much the same scene</p>
      <p align="center">was created stating that this was what the telephone 
      would be in the year 2000.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">Bell Laboratories was already researching video 
      telephone technologies in</p>
      <p align="center">the late 1920’s, and the vision is further fueled by the 
      1927 movie ‘Metropolis’ in a</p>
      <p align="center">scene of two men talking on huge wall sized telephone 
      system with a small video</p>
      <p align="center">screen so they could see each other while talking 
      through standard telephone handsets.</p>
      <p align="center">Bell Laboratories set up a demonstration of its 
      ‘Picture-Phone’ between Los</p>
      <p align="center">Angeles and New York in 1956, finally showing the vision 
      of communicating by live</p>
      <p align="center">images to be a reailty.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">The system actually required three dedicated specialized 
      phone lines; One</p>
      <p align="center">line each for video to New York, one to Los Angeles and 
      a third line for the audio</p>
      <p align="center">conversation was then required and all of these dedicate 
      lines had to be synced</p>
      <p align="center">together across the telephone carrier’s network. </p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center">The really big public awareness of videophones&nbsp; 
      would come at the </p>
      <p align="center">1964 World’s Faire in New York where demonstrations</p>
      <p align="center">between New York and Washington DC were shown. Just as 
      the earlier picturephone</p>
      <p align="center">prototypes required three special dedicated lines, the 
      1964 system did as well.</p>
      <p align="center">Bell Labs attempted several commercial installations of 
      the picture-phone networks</p>
      <p align="center">into New York, Washington DC and Chicago, however at the 
      cost of up to $27 per</p>
      <p align="center">minute for a call the product ultimately failed.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">Despite the real world commercial failure of the 
      picture-phone due to its</p>
      <p align="center">specialized infrastructure needs and its overly 
      expensive cost, the public still became</p>
      <p align="center">captivated by the idea of one day being able to have 
      actual video phone calls. </p>

      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">This would reach new heights as the result of the futuristic 
      cartoon show The Jetson’s</p>
      <p align="center">when it aired in 1962, making video phone calls a common 
      occurrence in almost</p>
      <p align="center">every episode. In 1969, Stanley Kubrick’s science 
      fiction fantasy ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’</p>
      <p align="center">would also show a very realistic scene of a father 
      placing a video phone call to</p>
      <p align="center">his daughter on what the movie would depict as being an 
      AT&amp;T public payphone in</p>
      <p align="center">the future.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="center">

      <p align="center">Only further inspired by all this, AT&amp;T with its 
      research and marketing</p>
      <p align="center">muscle as well as large coffers of financial resources 
      to tap into, would not give up</p>
      <p align="center">this uphill battle to take videophones from fantasy to 
      commercial viability. In 1970,</p>
      <p align="center">AT&amp;T would try it once again with its Picturephone II 
      system and network in Pittsburgh,</p>
      <p align="center">Pennsylvania. Just as quickly however, it would silently 
      admit defeat and shut</p>
      <p align="center">it down as the Bell telephone giant would step back and 
      not make another attempt</p>
      <p align="center">for almost 15 more years.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">In the foothills of the California Sierra Mountains in 
      1976, back in the Grass</p>
      <p align="center">Valley Research and Development Lab, the Cyan 
      engineering team decided to take</p>
      <p align="center">up the call. Called ‘Phoney,’ it’s a remarkable design 
      for video transmission technology.</p>
      <p align="center">“Bear in mind that we did not have DSP chips and a lot 
      of cheap memory</p>
      <p align="center">available, so it was a challenge to do anything 
      practical,” recalls Larry Emmons. The</p>
      <p align="center">concept design and ideas are shown to Nolan Bushnell and 
      Joe Keenan, at which</p>
      <p align="center">point Joe came up with the idea that this could be an 
      entertainment-based device,</p>
      <p align="center">basing the design around a toy instead of something for 
      business or commercial use.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">With that in mind, Larry Emmons, Dave Stokes and Michael 
      Cooperhart</p>
      <p align="center">begin work on building a simulation prototype. While 
      Larry and Dave worked on</p>
      <p align="center">the engineering side, Michael became the Project Concept 
      Manager - after all, he</p>
      <p align="center">was hired to do project management and industrial design 
      and to help get projects</p>
      <p align="center">(specifically the video project) funded and into 
      production. The video project certainly</p>
      <p align="center">needed a kick start and funding!</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">When Michael first saw the project in the lab it was 
      just a small 16 x 16 image</p>
      <p align="center">on a 19-inch open frame monitor, and he immediately knew 
      what was needed was a</p>
      <p align="center">demonstration prototype and a funding proposal. Moving 
      forward, the team built</p>
      <p align="center">the demonstration prototype, consisting of two desktop 
      base units that were each</p>
      <p align="center">wired across the lab into a card cage system holding all 
      of the electronics. Since this</p>
      </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
      <p align="center">was just for the very early stages of product 
      development, its physical size and the</p>
      <p align="center">need to be able to easily pull out a section to work on, 
      made it a large system requiring</p>
      <p align="center">a card cage box for all of the major electronic 
      components to reside in.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">Unlike AT&amp;T’s efforts, the initial prototype didn’t 
      actually use a telephone</p>
      <p align="center">line, but instead used a dedicated wiring system that 
      ran from one office on one side</p>
      <p align="center">of the lab floor to another office way on the other side 
      of the lab floor. However, to</p>
      <p align="center">make sure that eventually the product could be 
      compatible with the standard telephone</p>
      <p align="center">line systems of the day, it was restricted to data rates 
      and capabilities that were</p>
      <p align="center">possible at the time (modeling capabilities after fax 
      machines which were just out</p>
      <p align="center">and very were expensive).</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">Larry Emmons and the Cyan team came up a this theory 
      that telephone</p>
      <p align="center">conversations had some degree of down time, with pauses 
      between words being spoken</p>
      <p align="center">where they might be able to insert picture data to 
      transfer. Their test vehicle</p>
      <p align="center">worked quite well, and the limited resolution photos 
      sent one person’s image at a</p>
      <p align="center">time; first person A’s picture was sent from one end of 
      the link, when that completed</p>
      <p align="center">the process was reversed. With this setup, voice had 
      priority over the picture, and the</p>
      <p align="center">remote photo would be received line by line during 
      lapses in audio.</p>
      <p align="center">One afternoon, Nolan and company traveled to Grass 
      Valley for a demonstration</p>
      <p align="center">of the picture phone during their regular checking of 
      the status of Cyan’s</p>
      <p align="center">projects. When it came time to demonstrate the phone, 
      they had one part of it set</p>
      <p align="center">up in the main office, and the second part in a back 
      lab. Everyone played with it</p>
      <p align="center">for awhile and had a good time testing it out, but as 
      they retired to the main office,</p>
      <p align="center">Nolan abruptly disappeared. The demo was still active 
      with empty photos being exchanged</p>
      <p align="center">on the device, when suddenly during their conversation 
      Lanny Netz noticed</p>
      <p align="center">a troubling and disturbingly recognizable object coming 
      in on the video feed.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">Trying to divert everyone’s attention from the screen, 
      Larry kept everyone talking</p>
      <p align="center">while he tried to block the incoming image by using up 
      all of the priority data transfer.</p>
      <p align="center">However, the inevitable occurred: The image fully 
      processed onto the screen for</p>
      <p align="center">everyone in the front office to discover where Nolan had 
      disappeared to and what he</p>
      <p align="center">was doing. The site of Nolan’s rounded ass cheeks were 
      what greeted the room full</p>
      <p align="center">of people, a digitized mooning! Not quite the same 
      historic reverence as the famous</p>
      <p align="center">Bell &amp; Watson ‘Come Here!’ moment in telephone history, 
      but certainly a memorable,</p>
      <p align="center">landmark (and classic ‘Atari-style’) moment for all who 
      were present for this</p>
      <p align="center">graphic ‘full moon’ eclipse!!!</p>
      </font>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
      <p align="center">After the demonstration, Ron Milner (though not involved 
      in the project)</p>
      <p align="center">needed a power supply to use for a different project and 
      the demonstration system</p>
      <p align="center">had a perfect power supply that he could use. Proceeding 
      to disconnect the power</p>
      <p align="center">supply, he unknowingly let the 110v ‘hot’ wire which was 
      still live touch the 5v line</p>
      <p align="center">on the card cage. The result was a room full of 
      fireworks and smoke, as each of the</p>
      <p align="center">cards proceeded, almost in a queued fireworks sequence 
      to spark, to smoke and burn</p>
      <p align="center">out. “It was quite a fireworks show. Luckily it didn’t 
      burn the lab down or set off the</p>
      <p align="center">sprinkler system,” recalls Ron Milner.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">As for courting funding from Atari for a project such as 
      this, Michael became</p>
      <p align="center">so successful in this process that he gained the 
      nickname Michael “Corporate-</p>
      <p align="center">Hart” of which he was actually proud to hold the title 
      of. Someone had to help get</p>
      <p align="center">these great ideas funded and into production and Michael 
      would become the man</p>
      <p align="center">behind the curtain whose job it was to glorify the great 
      work being done by Cyan.</p>
      <p align="center">Although work continued on ‘Phoney,’ by 1979 it’s moved 
      to Cyan’s backburner</p>
      <p align="center">and then added to a Grass Valley Project Summaries 
      document under the</p>
      <p align="center">category, ‘Disasters.’ </p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">However in 1981, ‘Project P’ (as it is now called) makes 
      a comeback</p>
      <p align="center">when in the engineering summaries for that year it’s 
      dryly noted, ‘try it again.’</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">This new interest may have been prompted by Steve 
      Bristow’s new division called</p>
      <p align="center">‘Ataritel,’ put together to bring Atari into the 
      consumer telephone market with a</p>
      <p align="center">series of high tech phones with never before seen 
      features. Bristow sees ‘Phoney’ as a</p>
      <p align="center">compliment to the new division, and the still separate 
      video phone project becomes</p>
      <p align="center">known under Ataritel as Eagle or alternately Eagle Eye.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">By the end of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, a 
      great many homes were</p>
      <p align="center">still using rotary dial phones because of the still 
      uneasy process of getting a touchtone</p>
      <p align="center">phone. First, you had to order touchtone service for 
      your telephone line and</p>
      <p align="center">depending on your area, that could cost an extra $2 to 
      $5 per month. Then once you</p>
      <p align="center">had touch-tone service, you could look to rent a 
      touch-tone phone. That’s right, rent</p>
      <p align="center">- these were the days you couldn’t buy your phones, you 
      had to rent them from Bell</p>
      <p align="center">Telephone. And once you ordered your upgraded phone line 
      and phone, then a Bell</p>
      <p align="center">telephone technician would come to your home and install 
      it for an additional fee.</p>
      <p align="center">Hopefully you get the point that there was a market ripe 
      for competition here.</p>
      </font>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
      <p align="center">Why were there so few compeitors? Originally, Bell 
      Telephone would not</p>
      <p align="center">allow any non approved telephones to be plugged into its 
      network or to even allow</p>
      <p align="center">any modifications to its devices. In 1956, a lawsuit was 
      won against Bell Telephone</p>
      <p align="center">that would allow the use of non-Bell Telephone devices 
      and the modification of Bell</p>
      <p align="center">Telephone devices as long as there would be no damage 
      caused to the network or its</p>
      <p align="center">devices. Unfortunately, save for novelty phones and big 
      business, the stigmatism of</p>
      <p align="center">only Bell telephones meaning quality still sat in the 
      eyes of the average consumer.</p>
      <p align="center">It didn’t help that during any service calls or 
      installation of new outlets by a Bell</p>
      <p align="center">serviceman, the service call was accompanied by an 
      installer telling the homeowner</p>
      <p align="center">that plugging in phones not purchased from the telephone 
      company could cause</p>
      <p align="center">problems with their service and any service calls could 
      be very expensive. </p>
      <p align="center">This subtle pressure tactic would be used often in 
      trying to sway </p>
      <p align="center">people away from going it on their own.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">Atari’s entry into the telephone market began when Steve 
      Bristow begins</p>
      <p align="center">to assemble his new consumer research and development 
      team in 1981, one of the</p>
      <p align="center">technologies that intrigues Steve and his team were 
      wireless intercom systems. </p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">So they start to look at the possibility of doing something 
      like that with telephone applications.</p>
      <p align="center">They build a prototype line system and bring it out to 
      Warner Communications</p>
      <p align="center">in New York to demonstrate to Manny Gerard and Steve 
      Ross. Not only is Warner</p>
      <p align="center">interested in the prototype and the demonstration, 
      Steve’s consumer research</p>
      <p align="center">and development group is also now assigned to be Atari’s 
      new telephone division</p>
      <p align="center">called ‘Ataritel.’ The idea of developing a line of 
      phone systems that would provide</p>
      <p align="center">such luxury features to an eager buying public was not 
      to be ignored. Atari engineers</p>
      <p align="center">could see this need, and Warner Communications fully 
      supported the idea of its</p>
      <p align="center">high tech subsidiary branching out into this field – a 
      field which would certainly be</p>
      <p align="center">a strong profit center by delivering much wanted and 
      needed conveniences to homeowners.</p>
      <p align="center">Marketing and management at Atari, who had many times 
      shut down numerous</p>
      <p align="center">game products out of fear they could impact sales of the 
      Atari VCS, also</p>
      <p align="center">welcomed this new product line. The fact it would not be 
      entertainment-based meant</p>
      <p align="center">it would not compete in any way with the Atari VCS or 
      its cartridge sales - or more</p>
      <p align="center">importantly their bonuses.</p>
      </font>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
      <p align="center">The planned line of telephones will offer advanced 
      features not commonly</p>
      <p align="center">seen at the time, such as redial, call waiting switch, 
      mute, hold and a full duplex</p>
      <p align="center">speakerphone which would allow both parties to talk and 
      hear each other at the</p>
      <p align="center">same time. Not a problem today, this was a very 
      difficult technological hurdle at the</p>
      <p align="center">time and would give the product line a huge feature 
      selling advantage.</p>
      <p align="center">There is also talk of possibly incorporating home 
      control features, but another</p>
      <p align="center">very advanced design called ‘power line transmission 
      technology’ is instead</p>
      <p align="center">pursued for what will be called the ‘Telectra’ line of 
      telephones. Many homes were</p>
      <p align="center">only wired for telephones in specific, high traffic 
      areas - generally in the kitchen as</p>
      <p align="center">the primary phone and a phone in perhaps a den or living 
      room, and maybe in the</p>
      <p align="center">main bedroom. This usually posed a problem for the new 
      home telephone market, as</p>
      <p align="center">you would still be at the mercy of the telephone company 
      to have to come into your</p>
      <p align="center">home and charge you to run additional telephone outlets 
      in other areas of the home.</p>
      <p align="center">Atari knew that in order to get into homes in any 
      volume, they would have</p>
      <p align="center">to win over the hearts and minds of the consumer by 
      giving them easy to use yet</p>
      <p align="center">high-tech features far ahead of Bell and everyone else. 
      Most importantly, power line</p>
      <p align="center">telephone systems would be their solution to get past 
      Bell’s control of the phone outlets</p>
      <p align="center">in the home. A power line telephone system consists of a 
      Master Station which</p>
      <p align="center">plugs in to the already existing telephone jack and into 
      a standard wall outlet. The</p>
      <p align="center">catch is, the outlet isn’t just for power, but is also 
      used for communication with a set</p>
      <p align="center">of satellite phones. The master station would 
      essentially be set with its own home</p>
      <p align="center">telephone network, allowing the homeowner to buy 
      additional extension phones and</p>
      <p align="center">set them to the same network setting as the master 
      station. All you would have to</p>
      <p align="center">then do is plug the extension phone-set anywhere in the 
      home into a power outlet,</p>
      <p align="center">pick up the receiver and you would now have telephone 
      service in that room. Now a</p>
      <p align="center">homeowner could take a call in the kitchen, place a 
      person on hold, and then go into</p>
      <p align="center">their office or another room, pick up the extension set 
      and have their conversation.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">The phones could also act as intercoms between rooms as 
      well.</p>
      <p align="center">For the next two years the product engineering and 
      designs would evolve.</p>
      <p align="center">Porsche Design and Morison Cousins Associates would be 
      contracted to provide</p>
      <p align="center">design services and give the new products a unique and 
      state of the art look. The</p>
      <p align="center">designs by Morison Cousins are chosen for their 
      ‘Space-tel’ look which have very</p>
      <p align="center">clean, attractive and appealing high tech presence. 
      They’re also easy to use and are</p>
      <p align="center">designed to fit the many different functions that the 
      various models and product</p>
      <p align="center">lines will need to accommodate. </p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">By March 1983, after nearly two years of working in 
      secret, </p>
      <p align="center">Atari announces its new secret division to the public. 
      To add an additional air of  </p>
      <p align="center">mystery to the whole affair, Marketing, which is 
      handled by Dick Mier, releases a</p>
      <p align="center">Press announcement that the entire division has been secretly operating</p>
      <p align="center">under the codename ‘Project Falcon.’</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">In fact, unlike previous Atari products that usually had 
      their codenames</p>
      <p align="center">after women, the Ataritel product codenames were all 
      after birds - Falcon, Eagle,</p>
      <p align="center">Pudgy and Parrot. An effective marketing campaign is 
      launched, featuring the Ataritel</p>
      <p align="center">name covered under a tarp; you could clearly read the 
      name, but it gave the</p>
      <p align="center">perception to everyone that there would be so much more 
      revealed when the wraps</p>
      <p align="center">came off. Marketing specialist Kim Soulek would 
      demonstrate the prototype designs</p>
      <p align="center">at numerous events and tradeshows throughout the year, 
      including the Telephone</p>
      <p align="center">Show in San Francisco.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">Unfortunately, shortly after the showing a number of 
      events occur surrounding</p>
      <p align="center">the appearance of James Morgan, Atari’s new CEO who 
      takes over the</p>
      <p align="center">reins of the company from Ray Kassar after massive 
      financial losses. After a month</p>
      <p align="center">long evaluation period, James begins to cut projects and 
      products across the board</p>
      <p align="center">that he feels are not necessary to Atari’s recovery. 
      Ataritel will be one of those projects.</p>
      <p align="center">Initially, its staff is cut back in September, but by 
      October most of the division</p>
      <p align="center">staff has scattered to other projects and departments or 
      they have left the company</p>
      <p align="center">all together. Internally, Ataritel is shuttered - even 
      Steve Bristow has moved</p>
      <p align="center">over to the Home Computer Division to work with Dave 
      Stubben on refocusing the</p>
      <p align="center">division’s product strategy and map out new computers 
      and products for the next</p>
      <p align="center">two years. The phones of the future will not get their 
      chance to be released in the</p>
      <p align="center">future and Ataritel, treated like an unwanted phone 
      call, is put on permanent hold.</p>
      <p align="center">A glimmer of hope for the product line was seen in 
      April, 1984 after a simple</p>
      <p align="center">announcement that Atari is still considering a release 
      of its line of Ataritel products.</p>
      <p align="center">But other than this announcement, nothing actually ever 
      comes of it. Word also</p>
      <p align="center">reaches Cyan that the Ataritel project has been canceled 
      and their work on ‘Project</p>
      <p align="center">P’ has been canceled along with it. The video phone too 
      will not get its chance to</p>
      <p align="center">make it out of Cyan’s lab and into the hands of 
      consumers. The Falcon, Eagle and the</p>
      <p align="center">nest eggs have all been grounded.</p>

      <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
      <p align="center">During the turmoil of 1984 and the sale of the Consumer 
      Division (which</p>
      <p align="center">includes the Home Computer Division) to Tramel 
      Technologies, Ltd. on July 2, 1984,</p>
      <p align="center">the Ataritel division is retained by Warner 
      Communications along with the Coinop</p>
      <p align="center">Division and the Atari Adventure Centers division. The 
      former management of</p>
      <p align="center">Ataritel tried to see if they could purchase the 
      division outright from Warner and</p>
      <p align="center">spin it off as an independent company separate from 
      Warner. Warner, unfortunately,</p>
      <p align="center">would not agree to the terms of the offer. Seeing the 
      value in Ataritel’s assets and</p>
      <p align="center">specifically the video phone product, Manny Gerard 
      negotiates to sell the product to</p>
      <p align="center">a company called Medama, which was a newly formed U.S. 
      subsidiary of Mitsubishi</p>
      <p align="center">Electric established as a development and marketing 
      company for the U.S. market.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">While looking to take Ataritel independent, Roy Elkins 
      approaches Medama</p>
      <p align="center">for funding and after Warner won’t spin off the division 
      he makes the introduction</p>
      <p align="center">to Manny Gerard about purchasing the rights, IP and 
      assets to the videophone project.</p>
      <p align="center">During one of the demonstration meetings with Warner, 
      Ataritel and Medama,</p>
      <p align="center">the Cyan videophone is set up in the Warner conference 
      room in New York. Back</p>
      <p align="center">in Grass Valley, Michael Cooper-Hart is preparing to 
      send a video transmission to</p>
      <p align="center">demonstrate the product to the Mitsubishi team from 
      Japan. Cyan’s Larry Emmons</p>
      <p align="center">is also on hand for the meeting, so he initiates a 
      videophone call with Michael Cooper-</p>
      <p align="center">Hart. Michael is on the speakerphone and tells Larry 
      that a friend dropped by</p>
      <p align="center">to see him and an image of a Playboy centerfold begins 
      to appear on the screen in</p>
      <p align="center">the Warner conference room. The room breaks out in 
      laughter, and that pretty much</p>
      <p align="center">seals the deal to move forward with negotiations to 
      purchase the video phone product.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">During negotiations, Manny quickly discovers there is a 
      leak - that Stan</p>
      <p align="center">Zawadowicz, who is acting on behalf of Medama, knows 
      entirely too much about</p>
      <p align="center">the product including things not released in documents 
      or prevously discussed.</p>
      <p align="center">Manny decides to use this leak to his advantage; He 
      begins to discuss internally</p>
      <p align="center">within Warner and the Ataritel team that Warner has 
      received a far more generous</p>
      <p align="center">offer for the videophone project and that he is 
      considering negotiating with this</p>
      <p align="center">other firm instead. Zawadowicz suddenly comes back with 
      a higher offer and Manny</p>
      <p align="center">jumps on the turnaround of the situation by selling the 
      rights, IP and assets of the</p>
      <p align="center">video phone project to Medama for a much higher price 
      than he originally planned.</p>
      <p align="center">The original video phone team, consisting of Larry 
      Emmons, Michael Cooper-Hart,</p>
      <p align="center">Chris Wright and Roy Elkins will be joined together 
      again over at Mitsubishi’s new</p>
      <p align="center">U.S. subsidiary to take their work on the Atari video 
      phone and refine and complete</p>
      <p align="center">it under new design guidelines and feature requirements 
      outlined by Mitsubishi.</p>
      <p align="center">They’re joined by an old familiar face from many years 
      ago, Nolan Bushnell’s former</p>
      <p align="center">boss from AMPEX, Kurt Wallace. In 1986 the videophone is 
      finally released as the</p>
      <p align="center">Mitsubishi Lumaphone.</p>
