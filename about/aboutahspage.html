			<td><b><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">Who runs the Atari Museum?&nbsp; 
			(Meet the Team)</font></b><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The 
Atari Museum was founded by Curt Vendel who is the US contact and webmaster of 
the AM site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karl Morris is the UK/European arm of the 
Atari Museum while Markus handles the
Atari History Site: Denmark , David Leonardis is based here in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian Wiklem, a good friend and active member of the video game industry is also contributing great
assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Christopher Strong &amp; Glenn Bruner, both masterful
electronics wizards have constantly discovered new technical information
to share with the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Reese has recently come
onboard and is our resident devouted Atari 5200 fanatic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the very frequent former Atari employee's such as Al Alcorn, Mike Albaugh, 
			Steve Bristow, Owen Rubin, Regan Cheng and Gary Rubio are always contributing and 
sharing their insight and assistance to the site.&nbsp;&nbsp; Owen Rubin&nbsp; is even
hosting his website (<b><a href="http://www.orubin.com">www.orubin.com</a></b>) here at the Atari Museum.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Combined, we have
established a world wide presence in keeping Atari's history alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;We maintain and update the Atari Museum here
on the web at www.atarimuseum.com&nbsp;&nbsp; Many years before this,
Curt Vendel maintained contact with the Atari community through FIDOnet
which was a network of Bulletin Board Systems run by individuals who maintained
Atari message bases as well as Compuserve, he also ran an Atari users group
(SIAUG) and attended other user group meetings to show to members some
of the recovered Atari items and paperwork over the years as well as writing&nbsp;
many articles for other New York based Atari users groups (BAUG) and Bulletin
Board Systems (Fordham Prep).</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How long has the Atari Museum been in existence?</font></b>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; The Atari Museum was formerly named in 1997 when several former Atari employees 
and Curt Vendel discussed the large accumulation of paperwork, memo's, hardware 
data, engineering logs, software and hardware that had in fact become the 
history of all that is Atari and come together into one primary source.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Since so many former Atari people have come together and directed so much of 
their time and assistance for this effort the site was formerly named the Atari 
Museum .&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this it was an Atari website on the web showing many non-released
products.&nbsp;Much early than that a Bulletin Board system was
run out of New York City called &quot;The Star Trek BBS&quot; from 1986-1988 (though from 
1984-1985 it ran part time from 11pm to 6am then in 1989 it became "The Earth Access Center" and answered
and corrected questions and postings about Atari history and products.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
			<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFF00">Why is Atari Museum doing this?</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;At 
one point in time Atari was a household name like Coca-Cola, Band-Aid and 
McDonalds.&nbsp;Now in the Sega/Sony/Nintendo generation many 
only know Atari as that &quot;game company in the 80's that did Pac Man or 
something&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Atari's history and its accuracy are quickly being 
lost as each new game console and computer system is introduced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Many people never knew about many of the projects and technologies that Atari 
pioneered, or they did more then just videogames and had its own microprocessor 
design facility, a new Telecommunications division, it was looking into 
holographic games, did work for the US Military and was even looking into 
starting an on-line video games service through Warner/Amex Cable.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Even during the first years of Atari's computer division, IBM was in talks with 
Atari about a joint computer system or even in buying Atari completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Atari had a wide spread influence on the entire gamming and computing industry 
and many people working today can trace their roots back to Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Atari Historical Society is trying to track down and recover as much of the 
lost history of Atari as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the mishandling of 
previous owners of Atari after the sale from Warner Communications, Atari's 
legendary history from its archives was literally thrown out and discarded with 
no care, so we have made it a point to recover as much as possible and to 
reconstruct all that was Atari to help preserve it and help present this to the 
world for all to see and read. </font>
			<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFF00">Can people view the actual pieces in 
the museum in person?</font></b><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; Yes, the Atari Museum frequently displays items at various video gaming and 
computing events around the country and also places items on loan to shows and 
museums around the United States and Europe&nbsp; for display at physical 
			Museums.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also we have been scanning and digitizing as 
			much printed material, diskettes, ROM chips and VHS video tapes as 
			we can to preserve these items and put them up publicly.</font><p>
			<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFF00">I'm a Former Atari 
			Employee.&nbsp; How can I help?</font></b><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; If you are a former Atari employee from Atari Inc, Atari Corp or Atari Games 
Corp (Midway West) please
contact us, we'd like to hear from you.</font>
