<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi everyone, well this
has been a long promised addition to the site which I have received numerous
email requests constantly asking when it would be made available.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Please have a look at the new section in the Atari 1200XL section of the
website.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/computers/concepts/1200/concepts.html">Concept
sketches</a> of the original Atari 1200 Designs and its sister designs,
the Atari A-300 project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think everyone who is a computer
collector and interested in Atari's computer history will enjoy this truly
eye opening exhibit of the evolution and creation of the XL look and the
1200XL design, but also a look at an alternative modular expandable computer
system Atari had considered for a short bit but in the end chose not to
go forward with.</font>
