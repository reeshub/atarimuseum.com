<p>The final games are unloaded into the workshop at FunSpot.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gary and Curt pause for a moment for a quick photo
<br>with some of the games donated to FunSpot.... they couldn't have gone
to a better home and I am very happy
<br>to know that they will be played and enjoyed by many people looking
to relive old memories and for
<br>a new generation of gamers to experience there treasures of the past
and try them for the first time.
