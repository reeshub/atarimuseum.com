<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi everyone, well the
<a href="http://www.atari-history.com/computers/16bits/transputer.html">Atari
Transputer section</a> has some nice data now available, two Atari ATW800
Transputers arrived and numerous video boards as well as an ASCI Data Link
board and lots of software and technical data.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've gotten
the images photographed and posted up on that page as well as the Atari
press release info which was the first thing up on that page, lots more
to come so keep checking.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/computers/8bits/xlsystems.html">Atari
XL section</a> is in the process of a major face lift so things will be
changing their and many new XL additions will be following as well.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stay tuned for some
real unbelievable news regarding a very sophisticated, intelligent and
expandable computer system which was created to replace the Atari 400/800
line and right when it was ready it was cancelled and the Atari 1200XL
took its place.&nbsp;&nbsp; More info on that at the end of the month.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another trip is planned
for November 19-21, I will be meeting with several former Atarians and
perhaps a few current Atari employees at Atari Games Corp.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Karl Morris, one of the Atari Historical Society's other staff members
will be at Comdex this month to hopefully meet up with several other former
Atarians to gather additional news and info for the site.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">More news in the comming days, hope everyone
had a safe and enjoyable Halloween</font>
