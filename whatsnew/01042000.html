<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Happy New Years to all and welcome to the 21st century.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems
all those Atari 2600's, Atari arcade machines, Atari 800's and Atari Jaguar
64's are all still humming along without a single Y2K hitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well I hope everyone had a joyous and wondeful holiday and celebrated the
new millenium in a memorable way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the new year the
Main Menu has been updated and made a little more colorful and interesting,
I hope everyone likes it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/computers/8bits/morexlperiphs.html">Atari
XL periperhals</a> section has been completed and is now up and running.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Atari XE Systems section still has a lot of work to go and will be
attended to in the comming weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari coin-op section
continues to have new additions and updates and comming next week will
be a of real interest not just to the coin-op fans, but to fans of all
Atari products.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over 16 new and 8 redone <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/movies.html">Atari
AVI commercials</a> have been made ready.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Atari Lynx commercials,
the first ever scene on the web are available in the Atari Commercials
section.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming shortly: several new Atari ST commercials,
new Atari video game commercials, and Atari coin-op commercials so keep
an eye out for these new additions.&nbsp;&nbsp; These AVI's are ready,
however I am waiting just a little while before placing them up as the
site is preparing for its transition to its new server with unlimited outgoing
bandwidth and since many of these AVI's are 1-2MB's each, I'd like to have
these files on the new server.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a delay in the transition,
the installment of these new commercials will have to be delayed as well,
so hopefully this will be done without a hitch.</font>

Now onto the New Years announcement:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the last
several months Gary Rubio and Curt Vendel have been working together to
resurrect an old and lost add-on device for the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/7800.html">Atari
7800 PRO System</a>... namely: The <b>7800 High Score cartridge</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well I flew out to California back in November and picked up the final
piece to the puzzle and have completed the first breadboard prototype which
is working perfectly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The High Score cartridge is alive and
well thanks to the technical wizardry of Gary and a little bit of time
and soldering by me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We plan to offer 100 limited run
copies of the high score cartridge.&nbsp;&nbsp; These plug into your Atari
7800, then your game cartridge plugs ontop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These cartridges
only save scores on the original 10 cartridges designed for the Atari 7800
that have the proper programming, it wont save scores for Atari 2600 games
plugged into it either.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pricing will be $59.95
and these cartridges will be sold exclusively through <a href="http://www.myatari.com">B&amp;C
Atari Sales &amp; Service</a> and through <a href="http://www.atarisales.com">Video
61 Atari Sales</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expected release will be March 15th,
2000.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pre-orders are not being accepted at this time)</font>
