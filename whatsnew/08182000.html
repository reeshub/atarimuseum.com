<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hi everyone, hope your summer is going well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First bit
of news, congratulations to one of the AHS Staff members; David Leonardis.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dave has moved into his new house and is all settled in and is now ready
to begin making his own arcade room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More congratulations
go out to Mike Stulir of the <a href="http://www.backntime.net">www.backntime.net</a>
website, Mike just recently received a fully functional Atari 5200 Dealer
Display Kiosk for his game room which now includes 2 Atari Pinball games,
a Space Invaders, Gyruss, a Jaguar 64 Kiosk and now the Atari 5200 Kiosk.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many noticed that since 9am yesterday morning (Eastern Time) that the site
was unavailable.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do apologize, apparently there was some
kind of problem during some router/infrastructure upgrades which caused
the connection from the AHS webserver and Mailserver to go down.&nbsp;&nbsp;
However all is well and the systems are back on-line and during the downtime
the Mailserver hardware was replaced with a new HP Netserver, more memory
and larger hard disk so more future expansion is on the horizon.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The layout has been finalized the the final layout has been approved by
Sellam, who runs the Vintage Computer Festival in the San Jose California
Convention Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AHS museum will be on display
at the show, expect to see several interactive kiosks for people to learn
more about Atari computers and play some great Atari video games, products
will be on display as well as lots of surprises for everyone to see, learn
about and enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if your in the San Jose, California
area, stop by the San Jose Convention Center September 30th through October
1st.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will get the opportunity to see collections
from around the country on display, see some of the earliest computers
and video games, even a chance to see an actual Apple 1 and a Xerox Altos
(the first computer with Desktop Metaphor, Ethernet and Mouse) as well
as so much more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop by the <a href="http://www.vintage.org">Vintage
Computer Festival</a> website for more info.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">New updates to the website:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During a recent trip out to California
I had the opportunity to tour the valley and with a lot of help from some
fellow Atari employees who are also AHS members the beginnings of an<a href="http://www.atari-history.com/archives/paperwork/1978map.html">
Interactive Atari Buildings Map</a> is now up, if you've always wanted
to see some of the many buildings Atari occupied, then this is a great
webpage to check out.&nbsp; (Its still work in progress, Milpitas is being
added shortly and hopefully Grass Valley and several other locations as
well, so stop back to see more added.)</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/computers/8bits/xesystems.html">Atari
XE Section</a> has received a much needed overhaul.&nbsp;&nbsp; A new menu
has been set up and lots of new additions have been added such as an updated
Atari XEGS picture, the addition of the XF551 Disk Drive, and the SX212
modem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An interesting new addition in the Atari XE section
is the 65XE Computer.... or should I say Atari 900XLF.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,
check out the page and you'll see why... :-)</font>
