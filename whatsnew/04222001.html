<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>April 22, 2001 Update:
The Atari History Site</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wow, been a while huh?&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry for the long delay on an update.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well I guess many already noticed that some updates were already occuring
on the site by the new Main Menu that Karl &amp; and I have been working
on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The addition of the flash animation was all Karls
and it was a great new addition which later on may grow into making announcements
and such, so the new Main Menu is now officially announced :-)</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So what else is going on you must be asking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well David Leonardis
and I met up with our friend Matt Reichert at Phillyclassics this past
weekend and what a great show it was, David, Chuck, Marc and Jeff all deserve
major applause for a well done show.&nbsp;&nbsp; The room was a little
bit smaller then what was told to david so getting around the aisles was
a task of dexterity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The show was packed and I do mean
packed, the show literally was flooded to capacity from the moment the
doors opened and it was non-stop till closing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arcade
room was great with a mixture of wonderful coin-ops, some of which my friend
Cassidy Nolen provided (great stuff Cassidy!!!!)</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone
was there from the Digital Press guys showing some great new items like
Elevator Action and 7800 Pitfighter, some exceptionally cool Vectrex displays,
lots to see and buy.&nbsp;&nbsp; John Donzilla was there with his Vectrex
and Odyssey creations and later on below is a link to some truly wonderful
photo's he took of the entire show.&nbsp;&nbsp; Randy Femrite and his wife
had Battlesphere and other great Jag stuff on display.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then there was Mike Roberts and his wife and one of the most impressive
displays of handhelds I've ever seen, enough to even rival the great Clint
Dyers collection, again John took an amazing assortment of photos of these
(man that Big Trax brings back memories!!!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marc Pallante
had the Portable VCS, the Intellivision guys had the incredible Intellivision
Keyboard component prototype on display up in their suite, oh yeah and
don't forget the Storm Trooper at the front door (Man was security tough!!!
:-)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stormtrooper curteousy of videogames.net!!!</font>
