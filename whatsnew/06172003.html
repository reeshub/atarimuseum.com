        would like to thank everyone for the months and months of patience
        everyone has had with the work taking place on the
        website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what the heck's been going on
        !?!?!&nbsp; You might ask....</font></font>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karl and I have
        been working these past several months on doing a complete redesign of
        the directory structure and layout of the website.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also
        about 7-8 generations of old websites dating back to 1997 were still
        lying around scattered within old and forgotten area's of the site.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for
        the site to continue to grow and expand, its already at 713mb's to date,
        the directory structure of the site needed to be completely redone from
        the ground up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This meant moving a tremendous amount
        of pages, and data all over the place and in doing so the site's links
        all had to be regenerated and are still being worked
        on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why still so many pages are coming up 404.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karl and I are
        still continuing to evaluate and refine the site design and layout and
        especially the submenu structures.&nbsp;&nbsp; So what does all this
        mean to you the visitors of the site?&nbsp;&nbsp; It means easier
        navigation through the site, more new areas to explore and&nbsp; a
        larger and more comprehensive data store of files, images and
        information which can be directly searched or will be cross linked
        throughout the site.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; We have actually
        added a 2nd server to the site and bumped up storage to 40gb's and this
        space will not go to waste.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the physical
        paper-store of the Atari Museum archives is being scanned and prepared
        for posting, more commercials are on their way as well as internal video
        from inside Atari never before seen outside of the
        company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The media section is being revamped and
        already people have sampled some of the soon to published magazine
        archive, over at our friends at Atariage.com are magazines for Atari
        Age, Atari Club and many more, some have come from the atarimuseum.com
        archives but are also going to have mirror access here as well.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; As many have noticed
        and complimented, there are new menu's and graphics popping up all over
        the site and more are on their way, sorry for the long inconvenience,
        but in the end it'll all be worth it.</font></p>
