<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoa has it been a long
time or what?!?!?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know, I know....&nbsp;&nbsp; The
December 1st update didn't link properly and apparently everyone eager
to know what the lastest updates were emailed and let us know (boy was
the email inbox full !!! :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks everyone.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well some bugs in the file transfers are being ironed out and in the meantime
here is one of many updates coming in the following days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To kind make up for the lack of updates over the last couple of months,
we'll celebrate with The 12 Days of Updates (corny right? oh well, here
we go.....) :</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many people have enjoyed the wonderful
homebrew creations by some of the Classic Gaming communities hard at work
hobbyists making all of the wonderful Portable Atari 2600's.... what a
great idea, to take your Atari 2600 videogames with you, why didn't Atari
ever think of doing this????</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They did !!!! Have a look below at the
new link in the <a href="/A2600.html">Atari 2600 section</a>:</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="/videogames/2200/index.html">The
Atari 2200 Portable VCS from 1981-82</a> !!!</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ok, more updates to follow tomorrow....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Happy Holidays to all !!! :-)</font>
