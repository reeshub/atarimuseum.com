<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy New Year to everyone!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After speaking with a contact at Hasbro, it appears Infogrames is very
interested in doing a lot with their newly acquired Atari assests, so lets
see what the future holds and keep our fingers crossed on some really great
new Atari titled games to come from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as a reminder
for those who haven't tried it yet, head over to www.games.com for some
really great on-line Atari Arcade games.&nbsp; (Use Internet Explorer,
as Netscape does not work as well with the www.games.com site)</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/arcade/arcademenu.html">Coin-op
Section</a> is in the middle of an update, icons are being updated from
B&amp;W to color, new additions in the 1975-1976 have been added such as
Quiz Show and CompuGraph, more to come....</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/ataritel/ataritel.html">Ataritel
section</a> has a new facelift and the addition of a new link to never
before seen photo's and sketches of designs which were done by Porsche
Designs, these new images come to the site thanks to Karl Morris, the Atari
Historical Society European Contact and Historian, nice work Karl !!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many many thanks to Porsche Design for the release of these great photo's.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Added January 14th:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Also added into the Ataritel Porsche Designs
section is a link to the new <a href="http://homepage.tinet.ie/~morrikar/AtariTel.htm">Ataritel
section at the Atari Time Machine</a>, the Atari Historical Society's sister
site in the UK/Europe run by Karl Morris.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/ataritel/ataritel.html">Ataritel
section here at the AHS</a> also added is the original 1981 "New Business
Opportunity" Internal Atari document on the AtariTel division and its products,
this 133 page document (5.5MB Adobe PDF) details Atari's initial interest
and designs for its new product lines and its new division.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Karl and I have been really burning the
midnight oil (for Karl its midnight +5 hours since he's over in Ireland)
to make these new sections cross-linked and put together to really show
what Atari's amazing Ataritel division had in mind and what everyone missed
out on due to the divisions closure just as the products were being readied
for shipment.</font>
