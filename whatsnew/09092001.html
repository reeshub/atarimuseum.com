<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Atari History Site is on the move!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am in
the process of moving, after these next couple of additions to the site,
there will not be many additional site updates until November sometime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also all projects have been placed on hold and packed for the time being
for the move, the new 800 IDE board is in the process of a redesign based
on some fantastic work by Dr Clu for my friend Sijmen who's myIDE is the
basis for this new board.&nbsp;&nbsp; The floppy drive controllers are
just about ready, boards need to be run and cases modified, trying to work
on a deal to have an available upgrade from Bob Puff at CSS available for
the boards as well, still working on that.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 7800 Keyboard
is also coming along, hopefully all will be ready once I've settled into
the new house, the museum and arcade are setup and the archive room is
built and setup and my workshop is unpacked and back in action.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sorry for any inconvience this may cause anyone, please bare with me during
this move.&nbsp; In the meantime:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="mailto:karlmorris@atari-history.com">Karl
Morris</a> at the AHS Europe site:&nbsp; The Atari Time Machine will be
available for any assistance during this time and I'd also like to welcome
our newest AHS member:&nbsp; Markus of www.atarihistory.de who has joined
up and will become a part of the AHS network of sites.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last but certainly not least, atari7800.com
will be coming back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justin was sick in the hospital
and didn't confide in his friend Chuck, everything is alright, the guys
are working on a leaner, cleaner, nicer web design, they have caught up
all outstanding orders and deals and will be getting themselves back online
shortly, so look for the return of some really great Atari 7800 dedicated
imagery and information.</font>
