History Site Online Museum: February 27, 2002 Update</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought it was time
for an update announcement, even though the updates aren't exactly finished
yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karl and I have been completely reworking the entire
Atari Commercials Archives into a new section of the website called the
Video Vault.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This new section overhaul was needed due
the larger number of new commercials which have been added and are still
being converted and added into the new section...&nbsp;&nbsp; Many links
are still not completed while others only link to a single video file.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are working on both high and low bandwidth versions of the videos and
thanks to some assistance from the Digital Press editor, we are also looking
into streaming out video which would be in a higher quality format.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The new commercials are some
real milestones and eye openers:</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Atari's first ever TV Commercial: Atari
Home Pong which aired in 1976</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Atari's Super Pong console, also in 1976</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">8 Atari 5200 Commercials which are truley
amazing!!!</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A 1977 Atari VCS commercial</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Several Atari 2600 1982 &amp; 1983 commercials</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first teaser commercial for the Atari
Jaguar 64 aired in 1993</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">...also the 2nd part of the Jack Tramiel
Interview...................</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vault Video is still
under construction and still being updated over the next week of so, so
please bare with any missing links and such as the section is brought up
to full speed.... enjoy all of the great new media in the section.</font>
