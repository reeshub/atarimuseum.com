</font><font size=+2>Sorry for the long delay in updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However I there is good news and not so good news.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets
get the not so good news out of the way, in two days the 7800 High Score
cartridges start shipping...&nbsp; nope, sorry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
were several problems with the initial board designs (basically, some wrong
routing between chips), a new batch has to be made and that'll take 10
days to receive the new batch and at least 2 weeks to get the first 25
or so cartridges completed, and tested.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the release date
will be pushed back 1 month, I'm sorry to have disappointed everyone, but
this is also why no orders were accepted up front from everyone, even those
who tried to offer above the $59.95 sale price, so the new release date
will be April 15th.</font><font size=+2></font>

Ok, so now to some good news, the website is now on its new server with
9GB's of storage and unlimited bandwidth.&nbsp;&nbsp; So what does this
mean for everyone?&nbsp;&nbsp; It means the website is going to grow substantially
this year, so just for starters, go have a look at 25 commercials and promo
video's which are now available in the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/archives/movies.html">Atari
Commercials</a> section of the website.&nbsp;&nbsp; Included among these
commercials and promo's are never before seen Atari Lynx commercials and
some really interesting Atari Coin-Op promotion video's.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most
of the original AVI commercials have been redone to improve quality of
the audio/video, so download them again and see the new improved video's.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still more to come shortly thanks to Hasbro's Atari Division.</font>

<p><font size=+2>Next on the agenda:</font><font size=+2></font>
<p><font size=+2>The Atari A-300 Project (Computers Section)</font>
<br><font size=+2>The Atari 1200XL prototype designs (Computers Section)</font>
<br><font size=+2>The Atari CX-2200 Portable Game system (Videogames Section)</font>
<br><font size=+2>The Atari Video Touch Pad designs (Videogames Section)</font>
<br><font size=+2>New section in the Atari Standalones: Atari Electronic
Games (Handhelds: Atari Touch, Breakout and Space Invaders)</font><font size=+2></font>
<p><font size=+2>An old Atari office from Northern California was packed
up recently and is on its way to New York, over 1/2 a ton of hardware and
2 large filing cabinets of paperwork, schematics, blueprints and much more
from 1980-1984 will be examined, cataloged and added to the on-line Atari
museum.</font><font size=+2></font>
<p><font size=+2>Since space is now readily available and the Atari Historical
Society is adding another new staff member (everyone please welcome David
Leonardis) we will be accepting more requests from people on what they'd
like to see added to the site archives in as far as technical documents,
schematics and so forth, so please send us email and I will direct the
request to the various staff to scan and create new documents to post up
onto the site.</font><font size=+2></font>
<p><font size=+2>Finally, there are images and links that may be missing
or not working, this was due to the move and its a matter of translations
and perserving case when the transfer from Windows to the Unix server occuried,
so bare with this inconvenience and it will be corrected quickly, thanks.</font>
