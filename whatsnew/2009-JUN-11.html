        <p><font face="Arial" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First 
        off, the What's New &quot;Gap&quot; from 2008-2009 is actually very inaccurate, 
        there have been numerous updates, but most have been undocumented and I 
        am working on sync'ing the What's New updates with the site updates.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Also much of it was posted directly to atariage.com which is one of the 
        single best active communities for Atari discussion and development by 
        enthusiasts and homebrewers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Happy 25th Anniversary to the 
        Atari 7800 Pro System !!!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 7800 
        section of the website has gotten a major overhaul and lots of great new 
        eye candy and developer materials have been added.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
        many people know, the Atari 7800 is my all time favorite Atari game 
        console and I have been pushing for more support and development on the 
        platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through some efforts, I've 
        helped Bob &quot;Pacmanplus&quot; over at Atariage.com and from this he has 
        delivered a plethora of new titles for the Atari 7800 from Pac Man, Pac 
        Man Plus, Super Pac Man, Jr. Pac Man, Asteroids Deluxe, Space Duel, 
        Space Invaders and more are on their way.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kenfused has done 
        some excellent work as well with Beef Drop (a Burgertime clone) and a 
        Q*Bert clone as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some new faces on the 7800 scene 
        are GrooveyBee and Gorf, both of which are working on some great 
        projects...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So to help 
        things along, please have a look in the Game Development section, I have 
        added well over a dozen of the original source codes to some of the best 
        Atari 7800 games written from Centipede to Dig Dug, Robotron to Xevious, 
        Commando, and much more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope 
        these will be great learning tools and the basis for code for many 
        coders to develop on the 7800 and just as the Atari 2600 developers have 
        stretched the boundaries and created games no one would've imagined in 
        their wildest dreams, it is my hope that this same enthusiasm can carry 
        over to an open and active 7800 developers community and bring forth 
        games that would make even a NES owner envious.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, but 
        certainly not least, check out the High Score Cartridge section, a newly 
        unearthed prototype #1 of the original HSC has been discovered, along 
        with documents and sketches from GCC on the project.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer 
        everyone's question - yes, I will be making 25 special edition Atari 
        7800 25th anniversary High Score cartridges, I do need some help with 
        having a new label design created, so if someone wants to create one, 
        please contact me: <a href="/contact.html">
        CONTACT PAGE</a></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
        <font color="#000000" face="Arial">No -- I am NOT taking pre-orders or 
        holding any for anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will make an announcement in July 
        with a date they will go onsale and will post them up onto a storefront 
        that has been setup, it will be locked so only 1 per person can be 
        purchased and once the 25 are gone, that is it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So enjoy 
        the new updates and lets celebrate this incredible consoles 25th 
        anniversary...</font></p>
