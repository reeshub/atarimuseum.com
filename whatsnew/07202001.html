<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>July
20-22, 2001 Update: The Atari History Site</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several new technical
documents, schematics and specifications are being added to the archives
and to the Atari 7800 section in the following days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thanks to Art Ng, former hardware engineer of GCC, Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These new documents will be posted onto the site for all to use and enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Art Ng was the hardware engineer who designed MARIA, the graphics processor
in the GCC 3600 (a.k.a. The Atari 7800 PROSystem)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will
also be posting an interview with Art on the design of Maria, his thoughts
on the project and also working with Atari's Engineering division.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also, information from other GCC engineers will be added as well...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hopefully with all of their kind and generous help, many mysteries and
questions will finally be answered.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first document is the <b><a href="http://www.atari-history.com/archives/pdf/videogames/gcc1702b_maria_specs.pdf">GCC1702B
"MARIA" Chip Specifications</a></b></font><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="http://www.atari-history.com/archives/pdf/videogames/gcc1702b_maria_specs.pdf"></a></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second document is the&nbsp;</font>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="http://www.atari-history.com/archives/pdf/videogames/7800_OS_Source_Code.pdf">Atari
7800 GCC OS Source Code Listing</a></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="http://www.atari-history.com/archives/pdf/videogames/7800_OS_Source_Code.pdf"></a></font></b>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Later documents will include the actual
schematics of the MARIA 2, as well as the GCC fully commented source code
listing to the OS which contains the entire commenting on how the encyption
system works which should be easily reversed to create encryption checksums,
other documents include the programming guide for writing software for
use with the Atari 7800 computer add-on.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Also, just in are the original set of 5
"D" sized schematics for the Atari TIA chip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since it would be a monumental task scanning each segment of these sheets
down into 12-16 8.5" X 11" documents, what I am going to do is making a
small run of the sheets at a local printer for those who are interested
in these documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They cost $4 per sheet from the printer,
so the set is $20 plus shipping &amp; handling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
is no interest in profitting from this, only to provide knowledge and information
out to all who are interested, so if you'd like a set, I'm willing to have
10-20 sets made.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> <a href="mailto:curt@atari-history.com">Email
me if interested.</a></b></font>
