<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>It
seems that everyone really enjoys being able to get for free and play many
of the unreleased or privately held games in the Classic Gaming community
and lately many games are surfacing, the AHS is doing its part to help
out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although totally new to making ".BINS" we are trying out
best.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a few files are available, but many
more will become available, but the AHS needs your help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you have expertise in many binary images from eprom's, send us an email
and help out so that all the unreleased games and multiple variations of
games in the AHS archives can become usable "BIN" files that are free for
all to use and enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the link below to get:</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">SINISTAR for the Atari 2600, unlike the
previous released version, this one is much more playable and more complete.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">SPITFIRE, an unusual unreleased Atari 5200
Space Game</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Pac Man Jr., this unreleased Atari 5200
Game is unbelievable! Enjoy!</font>
