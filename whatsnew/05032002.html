History Site Online Museum: May 3, 2002 Update</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whoa!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; So What is new?!?!?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gotten a lot
of email over the months, "When's the next Update?!?!?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whats been going on at the Atari History Museum???</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That can be answered simply..... A LOT !!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there
has not been on-line additions at the AHS, a lot has been going on in the
real world having to do with Atari and its history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While it would be great to have a real and permanent museum which has been
a dream here at the AHS for a long time, the cost and logistics are just
to high at this time, so instead Curt Vendel has donated several coin-op
games to the Fun Spot NH (<a href="http://www.funspotnh.com/cspeaking.htm">www.funspotnh.com</a>)
Classic Coin-op Museum.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So what else is new?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Game On Exposition in
London will be taking place later this year, so the AHS has placed on loan
to the exhibit a Nutting Yellow Computer Space.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Recently the trucking company came to pick up the Computer Space for shipment
to London.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A week later Curt Vendel was contacted
by Game On, the COmputer Space arrived safe and sound and is being prepared
for the exposition, for photo's <a href="../../../../../whatsnew/computerspace/">CLICK
HERE</a></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Its been quite a few months, anything else been going on???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sure thing!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check out the Atari Museum exhibit
at this past weekends Phillyclassic 3 Show.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../../../../../articles/phillyclassic/phillyclassic3/">CLICK

step by step tutorial on how the 3 Store display Kiosks were built for

So, now as for the site?&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to fear, lots and I mean LOTS
of new updates coming quite soon including more detailed photo's of the
original all black prototype of the Atari Video System X, plus incredible
photo's of Atari's never released Handheld Space Invaders and Breakout
games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More doc's, info, flyers and photo's to follow!</font>
