20, 2000 Update:</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Several new updates have been added to the site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately
the DSL service provider has not gotten back to me on the date of installation
for the high speed dedicated Static IP service for the new server, so I'm
afraid those who have been waiting patiently on all of the new AVI commercials
will have to wait a while longer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its a shame too because Hasbro's
Atari division was kind enough to send a video cassette of all of their
Atari commercials which I would like to get up onto the site but we are
just about out of room on the server.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the DSL situation
cannot be resolved very soon I will see about some alternatives to get
the new server up and running.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/arcade/arcademenu.html">Coin-op
Section</a> several more flyers have been added into the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/arcade/arcade75.html">1975-1976
area</a>, still some more needed to be added then I will work on the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/arcade/arcade77.html">1977-1979
area</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/arcade/coinconnection/coinconnection.html">Atari
Coin-Connection</a> area has two more issues added for 1977.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also in the Coin-op section in the Puppy Pong link on the side bar is a
link to view the original <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/arcade/fullsize/snoopy-pong.jpg">Snoopy
Pong/Doctor Pong</a> coin-op.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the AtariTel section is a new concept sketch of a proposed AtariTel
phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/videogames/atari2600jr.html">Atari
2600jr section</a> is a concept drawing of a proposed Atari 2600jr design
which looks like an Atari 1200XL type look.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/A5200.html">Atari 5200 section</a>
is a really nice new section called the Atari 5200 Concepts section.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This new section features 12 images of various early design concepts in
1981 for what the Atari 5200 system was going to look like, including some
proposed Sears 5200 designs.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On February 28th on NBC there will be an episode of the show "Freaks &amp;
Geeks" where the main character will be buying an Atari 2600 with Space
Invaders, the Atari Historical Society shipped out several boxes of Atari
game consoles, boxed cartridges and other assorted items to assist the
set dressers in properly creating the scenes for the episode.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Check your local listings for times.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hasbro's Atari Interactive has informed me that their next Atari release:&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Atari Arcade Hits #2" is on schedule for release this coming spring.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It will feature Asteroids Deluxe, Battlezone, Millipede, Crystal Castles,
Gravitar and Warlords.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More details to follow as
they come.</font>
