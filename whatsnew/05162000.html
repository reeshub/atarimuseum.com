May 16, 2000 Update:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The site has had several
minor updates.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In the Atari ST/TT/Falcon section the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/computers/16bits/falcon030.html">Atari
Falcon030 page</a> has been finally fixed and added back into the website.
<br>In the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/computers/8bits/400800periphs.html">Atari
400/800 peripherals</a> section, the Atari CX-85 Numeric Keypad has been
updated with a new image.
<br>In the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/standalones/standalones.html">Atari
Standalone Consoles</a> section, the Atari C-380 Video Pinball image has
been updated.
<br>In the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/videogames/jaguar.html">Atari
Jaguar 64 section</a>, the Atari JagVR system has been added with a link
to a demonstration video from the 1995 E3.
<br>In the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/atarilinks/atarilinks.html">Atari
Links section</a>, the entire page has been reformatted and several new
links have been added.
<br>Karl Morris has created several new page headers for the Whats New,
About AHS and Atari Links sections of the website which look really nice.
<br>Most noticable is the update to the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com">opening
webpage</a> graphic which now includes characters from many of Atari's
coin-op through home console games.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For those looking for news on the Atari 7800 High Score
Cartridge, as of yesterday I have placed the whole project on hold.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The batteries are draining out in only 3 weeks and until I can find a solution
to correct the problem without having to go back and redesign the boards
to accomodate the fix the sale of them is on hold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
a board change needs to be made the cartridges will go up in price from
$59.95 to $64.95 since is will cost another almost $500 in setup costs
to make another run of boards plus I'll have to order the new boards, desolder
all of the test run carts and rebuild a new batch.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am looking
into non-volitale SRAM from simtek, if it works out and they can give me
a good price on quantity, that may be the route to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For those curious as to what they look like, screen shots, the cartridge
label and so forth, please visit the <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/videogames/7800/hsc/hsc.html">Atari
7800 HSC Update Page</a>.
