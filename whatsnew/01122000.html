On a sad note which I have known about for sometime now and have waited
for it to become official, Midway has officially dropped the Atari name
from its products.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari Games Corp, located at 675 Sycamore
Drive in Milpitas, California has been owned by Williams Entertainment/Midway
since 1996 when it was purchased from Time-Warner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since its purchase, many have noticed how with each new game that was released,
the Atari name and logo were becoming smaller and less prominent on their
games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last 6 months the www.agames.com and
www.atarigames.com websites have been slowly and steadily changed from
being an Atari dominate look to where Midway dominated the sites and the
Atari name was relegated to a contact telephone # in the sub-menu's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari Games Corp will now be called Midway Games West.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many
have already publicly voiced their opinions that Midway is doing itself
and the industry and injustice by dropping the very name that in itself
created the Video Arcade Industry and that it is a sad day for us all to
see the Atari name and logo on the final product: SF Rush 2049 and for
ever more see it disappear from the video arcades and entertainment centers
and leave the very industry it started and set into motion.</font>
