<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>November
21, 1999 Update:</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>Hi everyone, well I've returned from California from 2 separate
meetings with several former Atarians and it was quite a whirlwind trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm hoping to hear back from Karl shortly to see how things went with his
trip out to Comdex.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, there's lots to talk about
and it will be several weeks to process all the data, plus continue to
do the updates to the whole website as pages are being updated, content
is being changed and updated to reflect new information and new area's
are being added.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tonight I've added some new items which I could quickly add to the site,
the remaining items will take several weeks to get processed and placed
onto the site, so please be patient.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some of the new additions are:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="http://www.atari-history.com/videogames/2500.html">Atari
2500 all-in-one console</a> (seems to be very similar to the Atari "VAL"
System)</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="http://www.atari-history.com/otherprojects/bionics.html">Atari
Bionics Medical System</a> (no content yet, I have to discuss this in further
detail with the designer before the content is added, however the pictures
are available for viewing, please hold off on questions for the time being
while that area is worked on, there are also a few dozen pages of engineering
logs which will be made into an Adobe PDF and placed into that area as
well as some Internal Memo's and also artist renderings so there is a lot
more to go on that.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Items which will be going up in the following
weeks are:</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Atari 1200XL concept drawings/sketches
and designs in progress</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Atari CX-2200 portable Atari 2600's with
cartridge storage, plus some very unique concept designs</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Atari 2600Jr concept design</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Atari 5200 concept designs in progress
(the evolution of the console and other variations)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Atari A-300 Project, a modular computer
system design</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Atari 7800 Keyboard and internals</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Technical documents by GCC on the 7800
keyboard</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first ever screen shots of a working
Atari 7800 keyboard running Atari 7800 Prosystem BASIC and 7800 VideoWriter
software,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">in later weeks, some AVI video's of the
Atari 7800 Atarilab module being used and a 7800 touch typing program being
used.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Photos of the Atari 7800 prototypes (the

products sitting on a loading dock just rusting away :-(</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So its going to
be a very busy couple of weeks ahead, I would like to ask everyone not
to email myself or Karl asking to see images or sketches ahead of time,
there is an awful lot of information to work on and although its nice to
try and get stuff out directly to individuals, its not fair to everyone
as a whole, so all I can ask is please be patient and always and this information
will make its way up onto the site, but also remember that there is a lot
of work in progress on other area's and projects as well and they need
equal time.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Have a nice Thanksgiving,</font>
