<font size=+2>March 24, 2000 Update:</font>
<br><font size=+2></font>&nbsp;<font size=+2></font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few new quick
additions to the website, the new email server is now up and on-line so
myself, Karl, David, and all of the other staff members will shortly have
their new email address' up and running.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The possibility
of a mailing list may become something to consider for those who would
want to receive update announcements and news announcements.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Atari
Archives Library a new section is now up thanks to all of the additional
server space:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.atari-history.com/commercials/storyboards/">Atari
Commericals Story Boards</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a new section with actual
Story Boards for many of Atari's TV commercials, there are only a few up
so far, but lots more to follow.</font>
<br><font size=+1></font>&nbsp;<font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karl has been
busy working on a new interface for the Archives section to make it more
user friendly and easy to navigate, David has been hard at work on lots
of new scans of images for both the Atari Jaguar 64 section and the Atari
Lynx section.&nbsp;&nbsp; A beautiful Atari Jaguar 64 kiosk arrived on
Tuesday thanks to Bruce and Cathy over at <a href="/www.myatari.com">B&amp;C
Atari Sales</a>, I think they still have a few more left, send them an
email and see if they do and pick one up, its the ultimate "accessory"
for your Jag!!! :-)</font>
