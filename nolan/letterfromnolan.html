						<p align="justify"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter was mailed to The Atari Museum founder: Curt Vendel from Nolan
Bushnell's business coordinator, Loni Reeder.&nbsp; It
is both a pleasure and a unique privilege to have received such a wonderful
compliment from the man who's vision created the very company that has touched
everyone's lives in one way or another. Although Atari is far from
what it was in its early days when Nolan first started it, Nolan and everyone
else that ever worked for Atari can be proud to know how much of a profound
effect Atari has had on so many people. &nbsp;Even today there is a huge interest
in Atari, its accomplishments, its people and the magic it has brought to
all.</font><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br></p>
