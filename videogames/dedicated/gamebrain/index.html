The Atari Game Brain (Model C-700) was Atari's first cartridge based&nbsp; video game console.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Game Brain actually was nothing
more then an empty box with no major circuitry at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically
at had internal wiring run for input from built-in Paddles, built-in button controls
(pre-joystick design), fire buttons, game selection button, reset button
and power button.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">These connections all ran to a cartridge
connector underneath the center cover of the console.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">There
are also several jacks are on the rear of the unit that allowed the connection
of the older Atari paddle controllers previously used on the Atari Pong line of
dedicated consoles.</font>

The "REAL" Brains of the Game Brain were the actual cartridges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari had yet to finish a design for a multipurpose programmable console system,
that wouldn't happen until the Atari Video Computer System (VCS) model
2600 was to be released.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (It was the decision to place
all focus on the Atari VCS that brought the immediate demise of the Game
Brain.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"> All of the circuitry to allow a game to run were in
the cartridges.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cartridges were all based on already existing
stand-alone game consoles such as Super Pong, Video Pinball, Stunt Cycle,
and Video Music.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The top of the Game Brain opened by
pushing the Open/On/Off switch to the far left to the Open position and
gently pushing the back of the middle cover (nope, no springs to pop the
top open).</font>

You would then take the cartridge and set its Position Switch to "Disconnect",
then place the cartidge face-up into the slot in the center of the open
console.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in place you would slide the Position Switch
towards you to the "Connect" position.&nbsp;&nbsp; What this in effect
did was slide the actual PCB forward into the cartridge connector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You would then close the door and turn the system on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
nice feature was the instruction holder on the top of the console.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It held small plastic insert cards which told you basic information on
which controllers performed which functions.</font>
