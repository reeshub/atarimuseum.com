          the name of Harold Lee had become burnt out from his work designing 
          arcade game boards and he quit and left Atari.&nbsp; No sooner had he 
          left then he would receive a call from Allan Alcorn.&nbsp;&nbsp; Al 
          asked Harold a question - &quot;Could Pong be put on a chip?&quot;&nbsp; Harold 
          said it could be done and suddenly he found himself now hired back at 
          Atari as an outside consultant. Harold created his own company called 
          MOS SORCERY and setup shop in all places, a cabin at the top of a hill 
          above Los Gatos, California up where he and his business partner ran a 
          Christmas Tree farm that they had purchased together.</font></p>

          <font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000">Harold would now work on 
          the new circuits, which took up a total of 9 separate sheets of 
          circuit drawings.&nbsp; As he finished each portion of the circuits, 
          he would go to Atari and meet with Allan Alcorn to deliver them.&nbsp; 
          Al would then take the circuit drawings home and his wife Kate would 
          wire wrap that portion of the circuit together.&nbsp;&nbsp; As any 
          issues were found, Al would report them back to Harold who would make 
          corrections to his circuit drawings.&nbsp; Finally a wire wrapped 
          prototype was completed.</font></p>

          drawings into a tiny IC microchip that would hold all of the magic of 
          the original 1972 Arcade Pong machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; This magic would 
          have one additional part to it that the Arcade Pong didn't have...&nbsp;

<font face="Arial" color="#000000">The reason why Harold Lee was chosen to take 
all of the chips of the original Arcade Pong machine and squeeze them down into 
Atari's first ever custom IC chip was the fact that before Atari, Harold had 
been a chip designer.&nbsp; He had worked at Standard Microsystems where he had 
designed approx 12 different IC chips and of those around 5 had been produced by 
that company. Now that Atari had its own in-house chip designer and he had now 
created the circuits for their very first custom chip, the next hurdle would be 
getting these circuits onto a chip design &quot;CAD&quot; machine (CAD - Computer Aided 
Design.)&nbsp; Harold had experience on the Applicon system and fortunately 
there were a small handful of them in the Silicon Valley area. Even more 
fortunate was that there was one available for hourly rental so Harold was setup 
for after hours usage of the machine at a rental rate of $80 per hour.</font><p>

<font face="Arial" color="#000000">To see the machine in operation - follow this link to a YouTube video showing 
this highly advanced system which was designed around a DEC PDP-11 Minicomputer 
and used a vector graphics display:</font></blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <p align="left">
<font face="Arial" color="#000000">Now the product was on its way to becoming a 
reality. In the meantime Atari needed to sell the darned thing. First stop, the 
New York Toy Faire in January of 1975. Gene Lipkin and Al Alcorn head out to try 
and get the toy buyers to pick up and sell this great new product, after all its 
made by the most recognized company in the video arcade industry - Atari.&nbsp; 
What could possibly go wrong...</font><p align="left">
<font face="Arial" color="#000000">One would think that buyers would've been 
lining up to get a hold of this amazing new product, but this wasn't exactly the 
case.&nbsp; Those that did express interest in a home TV game system from Atari 
sat down with Al and Gene and discussed terms, conditions and capabilities. This 
was a problem for Atari, it was an arcade game manufacturer and seller. Atari 
had no experience in the consumer marketplace, no manufacturing capabilities and 
they still weren't sure what the product was going to cost to manufacture. One 
meeting really struck home with them when the buyer from Tandy Corporation, the 
owner of the Radio Shack chain of stores wanted to purchase Home Pong units to 
sell in its store chains.&nbsp; After discussing the product the Tandy buyer 
said he wanted an &quot;Anticipation Discount.&quot;&nbsp; Neither Al nor Gene knew what 
the heck that was, when they asked about it the buyer explained - &quot;Its a 
discount in anticipation of us paying you.&quot;&nbsp; So then Gene responded back 
&quot;So, your saying you might not pay us?&quot;&nbsp; With that they kindly declined his 
offer, to much the shock of the Tandy buyer, after all this was Tandy, which was 
a national chain and was considered the &quot;McDonalds of Electronic Stores&quot; because 
they were everywhere, had large inventories of parts and were one of the biggest 
sellers of the very popular CB Radio's during the 1970's.&nbsp; So saying no to 
them, was like saying no to the Walmart of today.</font><p align="left">
<font face="Arial" color="#000000">Time for Al and Gene to head back to 
California and rethink the product, as it really wasn't a toy and shouldn't be 
sold through toy sellers so the next idea is tried.&nbsp; It's a device for TV's 
so Gene Lipkin begins calling TV sellers, no one is interested.&nbsp; Finally in 
a stroke of pure luck Gene talks to a man by the name of</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000"> 
Tom Quinn at Sears, but he's not in the TV department, he's in their Sporting 
Goods Department. Quinn was what many described him as being a &quot;maverick.&quot;&nbsp; 
He thought outside of the box, did a lot of research and saw the potential.&nbsp; 
What Gene, Al and Nolan didn't know when it came to retailers, especially in a 
company such as Sears - you can't cold call them to sell them something.&nbsp; 
The buyers in the departments, they watch trends, look for products that will 
fit their need and buying trends and they go out and call on companies for 
products.&nbsp; So it was a bit backwards.&nbsp; However this time around 
instead of reaching someone who would say &quot;no&quot; and hang up, Gene connects with 
Tom Quinn.&nbsp; He is very excited about this, Atari says they have the real 
deal, and they can deliver it.&nbsp; Up to this point Tom had managed to get 
Magnavox out of the deal of selling its Odyssey with its TV's.&nbsp; This was an 
important step, but Magnavox was not delivering enough Odyssey's to meet Quinn's 
sales volume.&nbsp; Now these Atari guys call him up and they say they can.&nbsp; 
He's interested and it looks like there might be something to this.</font><p>
<img border="0" src="homepong/sears.jpg" width="600" height="300"><p align="left">
<font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000">So Gene Lipkin lets Al and Nolan 
know they might have a possible buyer from Sears, this is great but more calls 
need to be made until they can find someone who will commit and buy their 
product.&nbsp; Well two days after the call to Sears, bright and early that 
morning Gene's secretary says there is someone waiting in the lobby for him, his 
name is Tom Quinn. Gene tells his secretary, no you must be mistaken, Tom Quinn 
is the guy I called from Sears a few days ago.&nbsp; She says yes... and he's 
waiting out in the lobby. So Quinn meets with Gene, Nolan and Al and discusses 
his interest in Sears selling their Pong product, he will arrange for a meeting 
at Sears Corporate Headquarters in Chicago at... the Sears Tower, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
So Nolan, Joe Keenan, Gene Lipkin and Al Alcorn set off to Chicago for the 
meeting.&nbsp; They arrive the day before, so that night, fearing that the Home 
Pong prototype Al had carried with them might be stolen, they called on an old 
friend - Stevie Kauffman (who later would become an Executive at Stern in 
Chicago) to keep the prototype in his apartment overnight for safe keeping.

&nbsp;<p align="left">
<font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000">Time for the big demonstration.&nbsp; 
Nolan, Joe, Gene and Al are setup in the Executive Conference room at the top of 
the Sears tower, a TV set is in the room for them to connect to, Al sets things 
up, time to wow them with their Pong for your home TV.&nbsp; Power goes on 
and...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing, no screen, no display, no score, nothing. Al 
Alcorn turns off the Pong prototype and turns it over and begins changing some 
connections among the wires underneath in the organized chaos that only he would 
understand and be able to decypher.&nbsp; Some quick changes to make the Home 
Pong unit display on a different channel and suddenly the TV came to life!&nbsp; 
The all too familiar Pong playfield appeared, the game played perfectly and now 
it was time to talk terms.&nbsp; There was nothing actually wrong with the Home 
Pong prototype, what the problem really was, was that they were sitting 
underneath the largest and most powerful transmitting antenna's in the area, 
their signal completely overpowered the tiny little built in broadcasting system 
within the Home Pong circuitry that would transmit a TV signal over the wire 
into the TV set.&nbsp; Some fast and skilled thinking on Al's part, changed the 
channel setting to one that would not be occupied by a TV station signal and 
suddenly the Home Pong prototype was able to get its signal through to the TV in 
the conference room.&nbsp; This bit of difficulty is most likely what resulted 
in Atari including a channel select switch on its home console and all those 
that would follow, to allow the game owner to set it to an alternative channel 
(3 or 4) if they found that channel didn't work with their game console.</font><p align="left">

<font face="Arial" color="#000000">&nbsp;With the demonstration past them and 
Sears more interested than ever, further meetings are arranged between Atari and 
Sears. One such meeting was in regarding to the Elephant in the room, in this 
case - Magnavox. There was concern over Atari's product and the Magnavox product 
and any legal and patent issue's that may put a stop to this new business 
relationship.&nbsp; During the meeting, Nolan assured Tom Quinn that the Atari 
product and the Magnavox product would not be an issue.&nbsp; The following year 
when Magnavox sued Atari for Patent Infringement, Nolan Bushnell would have to 
testify to this account.</font><p align="left">
