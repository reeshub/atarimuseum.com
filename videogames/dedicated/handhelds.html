Atari started and quickly stopped its new division:&nbsp; Atari Electronics
Games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the products were the Atari Touch
Me handheld which was released in 1978 and coming in 1980 there would be
two new handhelds based on the Atari licensed Space Invaders and Atari's
own Breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These new games would be managed
through Atari's new offices in the Toy Building at 200 Fifth Ave in New
York City.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However sluggish sales in the handheld market
did not look favorable to Atari's management and the plug was pulled on
Atari's new Electronics Games Division and with it the new handhelds.</font></font>
