        Immediately after completing his work designing the Home Pong chip, 
        Harold Lee began work on Super Pong.&nbsp; He added in two new games of 
        his own design into the new console.&nbsp; As for Atari's sales of their Home
        Pong console, they were phenomenal to put it mildly. So Atari would
        continue to cash in of the PONG franchise by releasing yet another home
        version of one of its arcade game assets.&nbsp; Now home players could select for
        4 different variations of Pong games to delight and entertain them for
        countless hours.&nbsp; Meanwhile numerous knock-off
        Pong-type consoles were hitting the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        However, because of Atari's now well known presence in the Coin-op
        market, its name recognition helped it stand out. Also
        Atari's unusual Pedestal design helped Atari (and Sears who's Telegames 
        version of Pong, Super Pong and numerous other Sears Branded Atari 
        products) stood out in the Sears Retail Stores as well as other stores
        who were now carrying Atari products.&nbsp;&nbsp; When compared to the
        plethora of bland and boxy &quot;Me-Too&quot; consoles by so many other
        companies, the Atari &quot;PONG&quot; line of consoles simply stood
        out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari's consoles had eye catching rainbow colors and a
        deep and ear catching &quot;PONG&quot; sound from their built in speaker
        to draw customers right to them. Most other consoles were still far behind playing catch up with Black
        &amp; White displays, flimsy controllers and some even without sound.</font><p>&nbsp;
