<font face="Arial">So sales were doing their job, which was to get a buyer to 
sell this new product, meanwhile back in the engineering labs at Atari, the 
product development continued.&nbsp; Harold Lee now had a working design, but 
would now need more help.&nbsp; He would call on an old friend some Standard 
Microsystems named Bob Brown.&nbsp; Bob would now take the new chip design and 
run in through testing to make sure the I/O lines all worked and were within 
spec by design exercise equipment and tests for this new custom IC.</font><p align="left">
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;Several road bumps would hit Atari along the way to 
producing their first consumer product. Sears was not officially onboard, 
signing the contract to purchase Atari's new product under a new Sears brand 
called &quot;Telegames.&quot;&nbsp; However before the pen's hit the contracts 
negotiations would be rather interesting between the two parties. Sears wanted 
an exclusive, only they could sell this new product, no one else.&nbsp; Nolan 
and Co. didn't want to be cornered into this proposition and close the doors for 
potential bigger sales if this product did well. So they countered... Atari 
would give Sears Christmas 1975 sales exclusively, but Atari would want a few 
things, one being that Atari's name had to be on the product. This was unheard 
of by Sears on its own branded products, it never had a manufacturer name on 
their brands. However Sears finally agreed and Atari's name would appear on the 
Power Button on the Sears Telegames Pong consoles. Sears then had something to 
shock Atari... they wanted 75,000 units for its first order instead of Atari's 
offering of 50,000 units. Could they actually build that many to deliver to 
Sears in time???&nbsp; Atari's final really big problem... Money. No bank would 
give Atari the needed financing to actually produce the product. Sears however 
still owned its own bank in Chicago, a walk down the street and Atari now had 
the financing needed. Now Atari just needed to actually build the thing.</font><p align="left">
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;So the next order on the agenda back in Sunnyvale... 
getting the packaging done.&nbsp; Sears agreed to help Atari with its extensive 
experience in consumer manufacturing and would help Atari get its new Consumer 
assembly building up to speed for the task and Sears would also help get Atari's 
submissions to the FCC to go through more smoothly by assisting Al Alcorn with 
the submission process.&nbsp; The actual case for Home Pong however, that would 
be entirely Atari's task to handle.</font><p align="left">
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;Al Alcorn felt that the hard work was behind them, the 
chip was the hard part, plastics... that should be the easy part. That turned 
out to be just the opposite.&nbsp; Atari hired a designer down in Los Angeles to 
do the mold for the new Atari Home Pong. A competitor wanting Atari's business 
wanted to fly Al Alcorn down to LA for a surprise visit as he knew that Atari 
was being taken for a ride on the mold. When Al arrived, he found a garage with 
a press and a lathe and no mold base completed, this would be a disaster in the 
making.&nbsp; The new mold designer took what had been done and his lead 
engineer, after numerous verbal complaints about the whole mold base not being 
done right and having major amounts of corrective work, got the mold completed 
and done...&nbsp; Atari could now stamp out plastics, another catastrophy 
averted.</font><p align="left">
<font face="Arial" color="#000000">Once the first batches of chips starting to 
roll off the fabrication line, it was time for FCC approval of the device to 
pave the way for production. Sears would be instrumental to Atari in getting all 
of the needed materials put together for the submission to the FCC for the Sears 
version of Home Pong which would be manufactured and released first.</font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial">Home Pong was nearing reality as 4 chip fabricator firms were 
hired to run off chips, Intel had been approached as well, but it was very busy 
working on its new 8085 chip, no time for small potato firms like Atari...&nbsp; 
Harold Lee had moved on from being involved in Home Pong chip design to now 
working on Super Pong, but he was still getting engineering reports, it seems 
that the fabricators were having problems with the new Home Pong chips, the 
input lines were encounter leaky voltages and this was causing the paddles to 
&quot;jitter.&quot;&nbsp; The issue was soon ironed out and time was ticking...&nbsp; 
shipments need to be made and made soon, the Christmas sales season was fast 
approaching.&nbsp; Everything would come together and in the end Atari would 
meet Sear's order of 75,000 Home Pong consoles.&nbsp; So impressed with sales, 
Sears would order another 75,000 units right after New Years.&nbsp; Atari would 
then begin to sell its own Atari Home Pong branded consoles and manufacturer 
50,000 of those.&nbsp; Atari's new entry into the Consumer video market was now 
established.</font><center>

<p align="left">&nbsp;<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">The 
combination of the Sears retail channel with its Print and TV advertising, Atari's name and well known &quot;PONG&quot; 
label all came together to form a sales explosion of Home Pong.&nbsp; These 
        sales would 
overshadow the Magnavox &quot;Odyssey&quot; console line in popularity seeing 
        the Atari Home Pong units sell 200,000 units in the first year alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; The &quot;Odyssey&quot; was 
the first home video game console, yet poor marketing and sales pitches by sales persons 
        trying to give buyers the impression that the Odyssey would only work on 
        a Magnavox TV set to try and increase TV sales hindered its sales, yet 
        it still sold a respectable 320,000 units over its sales life. Atari's 
        Home Pong had full color graphics, score counter and excellent sound 
effects, giving it a better advantage over the string of Magnavox &quot;Odyssey&quot; 
series of consoles that followed.</font><p align="left">

        <font face="Arial">The Atari-Sears relationship would only grow 
        stronger over the years to follow with Atari manufacturing its other 
        Consumer products in Sears Telegames branding for many years to come. 
        Despite this strong new relationship, and profits for Sears, apparently 
        breaking company protocol as Tom Quinn had done -- by allowing an 
        outside firm to sell into a Sears department was not something that a 
        positive relationship or profits could ignore.&nbsp; Tom Quinn would be 
        fired for his &quot;maverick&quot; style and thinking... </font>
