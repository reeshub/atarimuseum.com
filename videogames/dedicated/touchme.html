          <p align="justify"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000">In
          1978, Atari
entered the handheld market with a home handheld version of its arcade
game called Touch Me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The object of the game was fun, simple
and challenging.&nbsp;&nbsp; The perfect formula for a game to appeal to
everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game would produce a sound and flash a
color in a series of patterns, all the player had to do was repeat them
exactly and their score would increase.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you completed each
pattern, a newer, harder and faster pattern would follow until the pattern
became a blur of color and sound.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many companies copied the
Atari game....&nbsp;&nbsp; ever heard of Simon?</font>

          for the &quot;Touch Me&quot; Handheld game, the mechanical designer
          flew out to Atari's Far East offices to complete the
          work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was difficulty in the design of the
          battery cover and the mechanical designer kept threatening to leave to
          return the USA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, his Passport was
          conveniently <i>&quot;misplaced&quot;&nbsp;</i> until the battery
          cover design was completed, hmmmmm...</font></p>
