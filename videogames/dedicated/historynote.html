<p><font size=+1 face="Arial,Helvetica">Atari 
got its start in the consumer electronics side of home entertainment with its 
release of Pong for the home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally Atari had planned to build 
50,000 units, however  Sears would order 75,000 of its version of Home Pong for the Christmas 1975 season 
and an additional 75,000 units in early 1976. The product was so wildly popular that 
for the 1975 Christmas sales season, people stood in line for nearly 2 hours 
in the cold to sign up to be on the waiting list for the Sears Home Pong.&nbsp; 
Atari would also release after Sears its own Atari branded unit and sell another 
50,000 units as well.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1">Atari continued its foray into the 
home consumer electronics market with various versions of Pong, then bringing 
home other popular Atari coin-op games such as Video Pinball, Stunt Cycle and 
even a hand held version of its Touch Me coin-op.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari delved 
into the unusual with its Video Music console which created pulsating patterns 
on the screen in sync with an owners home stereo system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other 
products were created which were Sears exclusives such as Atari Tank which 
appears in their catalog as
Sears Tank but was never commercially sold.&nbsp; The joysticks from the home version of Tank 
were then taken and slightly changed to eventually
became the standard joysticks which were packed in with the Atari 2600
VCS (Video Computer System for 1977 called the CX-10.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Joystick was created by John Hyashi and Kevin McKinnsey 
and sold over 60 million worldwide until 1992 in its later cost reduced form 
from 1978 called the CX-40. Another
Sears exclusive made by Atari was Sears Speedway.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1">To use up its large inventory of chips 
for consoles such as Super Pong, Video Music, Video Pinball and others, Atari 
created the Atari Game Brain console to allow all of these games to come on 
cartridge and be used on the console, this console never made it to market. 
Later on Atari looked into the hand held and table top market and created hand 
held Space Invaders and Super Breakout which were never sold.&nbsp; Also the 
boldest experiment in home tabletop electronic games was shown at the New York 
Toy Faire in 1981, the Atari Cosmos.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 3D holographic game system 
which was the first of its kind, the entire project was cancelled shortly after 
the show and never to be seen again. </font>
