<p>Beverly, MA (May 14,1999) - Leading entertainment software publisher,
Hasbro Interactive announced today it has released all rights that it may
have to the vintage Atari hardware platform, the Jaguar.
<p>Hasbro Interactive acquired rights to many Atari properties, including
the legendary Centipede, Missile Command, and Pong games, in a March 1998
acquisitiomn from JTS Corporation.
<p>This announcement will allow software developers to create and publish
software for the Jaguar system without having to obtain a licensing agreement
with Hasbro
<br>Interactive for such platform development. Hasbro Interactive cautioned,
however, that the developers should not use the Atari trademark or logo
in connection with their games or present the games as authorized or approved
by Hasbro Interactive.
<p>"Hasbro Interactive is strictly focused on developing and publishing
entertainment software for the PC and the next generation game consoles,"
said Richard Cleveland, Head of Marketing for Hasbro Interactive's Atari
Business Unit. "We realize there is a passionate audience of diehard Atari
fans who want to keep the Jaguar system alive, and we don't want to prevent
them from doing that. We will not interfere with the efforts of software
developers to create software for the Jaguar system."
