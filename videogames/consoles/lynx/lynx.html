<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1989 Atari, Corp finally 
managed to do one of the first intelligent moves. It purchased a portable video 
game system from a financially strapped game company called Epyx. Epyx which had 
primarily focused in the past on making video games for several computer and 
video game platforms had formed a new hardware division and with a team of 
Ex-Amiga engineers went to work on creating an all new powerful and feature rich 
portable video game system. What they had created was the Portable Color 
Entertainment System which became known as the Atari LYNX. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Lynx was impressive, a 16Mhz 
6502 system with built hardware scrolling and zooming, excellent sound and more 
importantly an easy to program networking language called com-lynx for up to 8 
Lynxs to be networked together for multi-user players. It had been mentioned and 
hoped that the Atari Jaguar 64 would use the Atari Lynx as a high-end 
interactive video game controller with such high hopes as being the motion 
tracker for Alien Vs. Predator or even a Tricorder for a hoped for Star Trek 
game. Unfortunately this never came to happen. Telegames has just recently 
released 2 new games for the Lynx and several other developers are working on 
Lynx games for the Lynx is far from dead, in many ways people sometimes feel the 
Lynx has more life left to it then the Atari Jaguar 64. </font></td>
