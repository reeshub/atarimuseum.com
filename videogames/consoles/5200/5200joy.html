Self Centering Joystick</font></center>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 5200 Supersystem was a fantastic game system.&nbsp; Atari took their
existing 8-bit chipset which was used in Atari's home computers and basically
turned an Atari 400 computer into a sleek black game machine that could
play the best games titles around.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font>

<p>&nbsp;<p><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><font size=+1> Atari also went a step
further
and designed the ultimate joystick.&nbsp;&nbsp; Featuring such innovative
features as putting START, PAUSE and RESET right onto the controller, the
gamer had complete control at the palm of their hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also
to fire back at Mattel Intellivision that continued to advertise how its joypads
were far more accurate then the Atari 8-way joysticks for the Atari 2600
(Model CX-40), Atari engineers lead by Craig Asher who was in charge of
designing many of Atari's hand controllers, designed the Atari 5200&nbsp;
joystick with a revolutionary speed sensitive 360 degree control system,
also it was loaded (perhaps overloaded) with an assortment of control buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font><p>Pri<font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="4">Prior
        to the 5200's launch, </font><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><font size=+1>many engineers petitioned Atari's management not to release the 5200 (many
referred to the joysticks as jokesticks) with its current version of analog
controllers but Atari under pressure from Intellivision and the newly released
Colecovision moved to use the joysticks as the were.&nbsp;&nbsp; The joysticks
are excellent for games like SpaceDungeon and Centipede and Missile Command,
but try to play Pac Man or any other game that needed precise 4 way control
with the ability for the joystick to reset back to neutral and gamer found
        themselves frustrated with difficult gameplay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently a newer
lower cost version of the 5200 joysticks were in the works (The CX-52L).&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gone was the rubber hood which wore away within hours with a newer thicker 
rubber design and added were spring
loaded potentiometers.&nbsp;</font></font><p><font color="#000000" size="4" face="Arial">While
        videogaming history seems to want to label the Atari 5200 with the worst
        controllers, this is not necessarily true.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        Colecovision controllers were painful and difficult to use for long
        periods of gameplay and while not suffering from the non self-centering
        issue as with the 5200 controller, the use of the joystick on its
        controller presented its own difficulty in use as well as the indented
        and strong springed fire buttons of the Colecovision controller.</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><font size=+1>&nbsp; While
        rummaging through a bag
full of 5200 joysticks which came to the Atari through a contact from one of Atari's
5200 former engineers&nbsp; just such an animal showed up from Atari's design
labs.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 5200 joystick which works FANTASTIC on games such as
Pac Man, Ms. Pac Man and Mountain King.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari engineers
also were working on a digital joystick and a 5200 arcade joystick as well.</font>
