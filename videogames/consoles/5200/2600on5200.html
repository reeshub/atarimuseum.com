<BR>Subject: DIY Masterplay Clone - 2600 stick on a 5200
<BR>Date: Mon, 1 Apr 1996 02:05:33

<P>The latest incarnation of the Vandervort/Tilton Masterplay clone.
<BR>*** 100% 2600 stick comatibility achieved&nbsp; ***

<P>Mark Vandervort (hy648@cleveland.Freenet.Edu) came up with a clever
<BR>idea to allow you to connect a regular 2600 stick to a 5200.&nbsp;
I
<BR>massaged it a little to come up with what's presented here, but Mark's
<BR>original idea was the inspiration.&nbsp; There's still a lot of the
original
<BR>in the current design.

<P>If you recall the last revision that I posted, there was a small
<BR>incompatibility problem with a couple 2600 sticks.&nbsp; No more!
<BR>Adding two diodes makes it 100% compatible!&nbsp; Works great with
every
<BR>stick I could drag out of the closet, including the 2600 remote
<BR>control joysticks and my Gensis-to-7800 pad.&nbsp; I've been using
it
<BR>for some time now with dynamite results.

<P>Build one for yourself and try it out.&nbsp; You'll love it!
<BR>If you can't get it to work, send me (Jay Tilton / jtilton@vt.edu)
your
<BR>questions.

<P>Materials needed
<BR>* (2) 1 megohm potentiometer, Radio Shark #271-211
<BR>* (2) 1 kohm resistor, Radio Shark #271-1321 (includes 5)
<BR>* (2) PNP 3906 transistor or similiar, Radio Shark #276-1604 (includes
15)
<BR>* (2) 1N4001 diode, Radio Shark #276-1101 (includes 2)
<BR>* (1) 9-position male D-sub connector, Radio Shark #276-1537
<BR>* Some way to connect to the 5200 controller port.&nbsp; Radio Shark
<BR>&nbsp; doesn't have any 15-position female D-sub connectors, but it's
come to
<BR>&nbsp; my attention (thanks, Ted) that Best Electronics does.&nbsp;
In a real
<BR>&nbsp; pinch, you can take 25-pin connectors and cut them down with
a hacksaw
<BR>&nbsp; to 15-pins to make a Y-adapter that pipes the keypad/function
key stuff
<BR>&nbsp; (pins 1-8) to a regular controller, and the joystick-related
stuff
<BR>&nbsp; (pins 9-15) to this thing.
<BR>* Tiny wires, and lots of them.
<BR>* Beer, preferably something good.&nbsp; Real beer isn't trasparent.&nbsp;
Real
<BR>&nbsp; good beer isn't even translucent.

<P>Function
<BR>* Pushing east on the stick shunts the horizontal circuit to ground,
<BR>&nbsp; mimicking the effect of infinite resistance between pot common
and
<BR>&nbsp; H-pot.
<BR>* Pushing west causes a short circuit between pot common and H-pot,
<BR>&nbsp; i.e. zero resistance.
<BR>* The potentiometers let you adjust the center position. Additionally,
<BR>&nbsp; the potentiometer in the horizontal circuit can be used quite
<BR>&nbsp; effectively as a paddle controller for games like Super Breakout.
<BR>* The fire button works exactly like it does on the regular 5200 controller.

<P>Good Things
<BR>* No more problems with games that were unplayable with your crummy
<BR>&nbsp; non-centering 5200 sticks.
<BR>* Cheap! Figure buying everything you need from Radio Shark, including
<BR>&nbsp; a nice project case to stuff it all into, would cost less than
eight
<BR>&nbsp; dollars.
<BR>* It should work with every 2600 joystick under the sun. I've tested
it
<BR>&nbsp; with my regular mechanical switch sticks, my Genesis-to-7800
pad,
<BR>&nbsp; my NES-to-7800 pad, and my 2600 remote control sticks, and they
all
<BR>&nbsp; work peachy-keen.

<P>Bad Things
<BR>* No second fire button.&nbsp; If you want, you can glue an extra fire
button
<BR>&nbsp; onto your 2600-compatible stick of choice. Just wire it up between
<BR>&nbsp; port pins 14 and 15.
<BR>* Won't work with games that require the analog capabilities of the
<BR>&nbsp; 5200 stick, like Missile Command.&nbsp; A few other games like
Centipede
<BR>&nbsp; and Galaxian make limited use of the analog-osity of the regular
<BR>&nbsp; stick by giving two movement speeds depending on how far you
push the
<BR>&nbsp; stick.&nbsp; With the adapter, you can only get the fastest
speed. It's
<BR>&nbsp; not a huge handicap, but it's probably worth mentioning.
<BR>* Neither this adapter nor the Masterplay interface gets along well
with
<BR>&nbsp; three particular games:&nbsp; Qix, Vanguard, and Ms. Pac-Man.&nbsp;
There could
<BR>&nbsp; be others, but I only own a third of the released 5200 library.&nbsp;
They
<BR>&nbsp; will respond to pushing east (or south) on the stick as if you're
<BR>&nbsp; pushing west (or north).&nbsp; No real clue exactly why this
happens, but
<BR>&nbsp; there is a way to work around it. Start up a game, slowly rotate
the
<BR>&nbsp; two potentiometers through their full range a few times while
<BR>&nbsp; thrashing the stick around, recenter the potentiometers, then
start
<BR>&nbsp; a new game.

<P>Possible enhancements not yet implemented
<BR>* 7800 stick compatibility (i.e. with two built-in fire buttons)
<BR>* Genesis pad compatibility
<BR>* Jaguar controller compatibility (Using the built-in keypad.&nbsp;
Tricky.)
<BR>* 2600 paddle compatibility
<BR>* Selectable/adjustable rapid fire

<P>I've received a question wondering whether there are any plans to put
<BR>this device into a limited-production run for sale to netters.&nbsp;
If
<BR>there's a large enough calling for it, I can certainly investigate
<BR>the possibility.

<P>If it were to go into any sort of production, it would have to be a
<BR>nicely done unit, meaning the tangle of wires would be replaced with
<BR>a printed circuit board, the correct plugs and jacks, no-brainer
<BR>plug-n-play operation, and a nice case.&nbsp; My personal vision of
the
<BR>final product would be functionally *identical* to the coveted
<BR>Masterplay, except it wouldn't have the slide switch that lets you
<BR>use the joystick fire button as the "start" button.&nbsp; (Pah!&nbsp;
Who needs
<BR>that bit of featurism?)&nbsp; A wild-ass-guestimate of the cost would
be
<BR>less than $20.&nbsp; Maybe it could be done for even less in kit form.

<P>If you're interested in this, drop me a line.&nbsp; I ain't promising
it
<BR>will happen any time soon, or that it will happen at all.&nbsp; I'm
just
<BR>looking to guage initial interest in such a thing before I invest my
<BR>time in scoping it out.

<P>Skoal!
