Spectradyne is a well known name in hotel TV entertainment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Supplying special closed TV viewing systems to hotels nationwide they allow
guests to view TV shows, pay-per-views and also view hotel information
and local entertainment events and listings of restaurants, transportation
and billing inquires.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1983 Spectradyne installed into select
hotels the Spectravision Hotel Video System.</font>

With assistance from Atari's CED (Consumer Electronics Division) Spectradyne
combined their standard tried and true movie selection system with an Atari
5200 video game system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system came in a special
enclosed housing to prevent theft/tampering of the contents and the unit
as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari Joysticks were installed onto the 5200
motherboard with slightly modified joystick ports and 16ft connection cabled
to allow game play from across the room.</font>

A special vertical riser-board was designed to accomodate up to 4 standard
Atari 5200 cartridges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The riser-board was hardwired
with a selection wire which was connected to the from control knob.&nbsp;&nbsp;
By rotating the knob the play could select a game to be played, since the
unit cannot be connected to a central computer, its unknown if the hotel
guest was charged for playing video games and if that charge was on a per-game
basis or timed.</font>
