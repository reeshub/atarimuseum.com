<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Atari could decide
on the name of the Atari 5200 SuperSystem, they were showing previews of
its new video game console and called it the "Atari Video System X".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Under Bushnell and then under Warner Communications, Atari codenamed many
of its projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Codenames usually were designated by
the project leader and these codenames came from attractive women the engineers
liked, some were their wifes names and one project was even codenamed after
a bicycle!&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 2600 was named STELLA, the Atari 400 was
CANDY, the Atari 800 was COLLEEN and the new Atari 5200 was named PAM,
later Atari projects would be: Atari 2800 (Codenamed Cindy), Atari 600XL
(Codenamed Shirley), Atari 2600jr (Codenamed Bonnie) and many many others.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interesting part
about the name PAM for the Video System X was that Atari was considering
actually calling it the Atari P.A.M. which stood for Atari Personal Arcade
Machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However the Atari VCS was renamed after its
model # which was 2600, so the VCS became the Atari 2600 and the new Atari
Video System X (VSX) was finally named the Atari 5200 to designate that
it was twice the power of the 2600.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari then
came up with a new color-coding system to help its customers easily find
games for the 2600 and games for the 5200.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gone went the colored
boxes and in came the silver boxes with Red stripes for the Atari 2600
and silver boxes with Blue stripes for the 5200.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Atari
Corp several years later claimed it came up with a revolutionary color
coding system: Red for the XE's and Blue for the ST's, gee I wonder where
they came up with that idea?)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Originally Atari's VSX Video System X was
showing its new game cartridges in a sort of brown box with red and blue
stripes along the top of each game image.&nbsp;&nbsp; Games such as Asteroids,
Adventure, Skiing, and Tank Battle which never made it to market.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It should be noted that Atari has listed Asteroids as game CX-5201.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Its believed that Atari may have canned 5200 Asteroids since there would
have been no way to properly play the game with the non-centering analog
joysticks which would have caused all sorts of control problems with the
ship.&nbsp;&nbsp; After trying out the prototype of PAM Asteroids, the
theory is correct, control is difficult and annoying at times and makes
the game less then enjoyable.</font>
