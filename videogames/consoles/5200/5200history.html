5200 Historical Notes:</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari
5200 was a brilliantly conceived system with a look and design that was
as ominous as it was sexy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 5200 case design was conceived
by Regan Cheng of Atari's in-house design group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
speaking wth Regan he explained that what he had in mind for the 5200 from
the start to what it came out looking like in the end was almost identical.&nbsp;&nbsp;
With a node towards the high tech, low profile line of stereo equipment
from the famed Bang &amp; Olufsen, Regan crafted the Atari 5200 into what
had become one of the most attractive gaming consoles to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Regan also designed a 5200 T-shirt logo for Dan Kramer who designed the
Atari 5200 trakball electronics.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dan was also the man responsible
for the famous "We're Just High Strung Premadonna's" T-shirts that many
Atari programmers wore after Ray Kasser called them "Towel Boys".</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An interesting
bit of history on the Atari 5200.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 5200 was originally
conceived and designed back in 1978 as an all new advanced high-end video
game system.&nbsp;&nbsp; However the chipset for the advanced system was
"frozen" for use in only the Atari 400/800 computer systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If it wasn't for Atari being caught with its pants down so to speak when
Coleco introduced the Colecovision, the Atari 5200 may have never have
come out since Atari's primary focus was on the "Stella" Atari 2600 VCS
system.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
interesting history note.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 5200 was nicknamed "PAM"
and almost became named P.A.M. or Personal Arcade Machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However at one point the Atari 5200 was almost nicknamed TAMMY after the
Atari production line manager, Brad Saville's wifes name.</font></font>
