While Atari did officially release the standard X-Y Analog joystick for
the Atari 5200 and also released the Atari 5200 Trakball controller, there
was plenty of room for other alternative controllers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A new self-centering joystick was being designed and also an arcade joystick
was in the works as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; However behind the scenes in Atari's
Consumer Electronics Division labs, one engineer took it upon himself to
design a simple, yet overlooked idea.... a 5200 Paddle controller.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Using nothing more then the potentiometer and plastic cap from a standard
Atari 2600 paddle controller and a resistor and some ABS plastic, Gary
Rubio (Staff Electrical Engineer)&nbsp; designed 20 Atari 5200 paddle controllers
for himself and others within Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The controller made games like Super Breakout and Pole Position a dream
to play.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The controller was never released for sale to
the public...&nbsp; but should have.</font>
