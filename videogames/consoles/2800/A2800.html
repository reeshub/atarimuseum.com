The Atari 2800 VCS, which was codenamed "Cindy" within Atari was sold through
Sears as the Sears Telegames II system.&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit was also sold
in Japan as the Atari 2800J.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An electronics engineer
by the name of Joe Tilly did the electronics design.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Atari 2800 had several new and unique features over the original Atari
2600/2600A systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

ports instead of the standard (2) two on the Atari 2600's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The unit also came with a new type of all-in-one controllers designed by
John Amber which sat in the users palm quite comfortably.&nbsp;&nbsp; These
controllers were 8 position joysticks as well as 270 degree paddle controllers
all in one and worked extremely well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2800/sears-arcade2-1.jpg" width="600" height="450"><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">More
commonly found and more well known then the original Atari 2800 was the Sears
Arcade II which was the exact same console, but Sears branded for the US
market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the same features, controllers and
enhancements were on the Sears version as on the Japanese 2800J
version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a different metal nameplate on the console and
on its controllers.</font><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2800/sears-arcade2-2.jpg" width="600" height="450">

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> If the Atari 2800 case
looks slightly familiar, that is because the basic case design was later
redesigned by Barney Huang into what became the Atari 7800 pro-system case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After a meeting in Chicago with Sears regarding the Atari 2800, Sears loved
the whole concept of the Atari 2800 so much that it was one of Atari's
shortest presentation meetings for a project to be accepted.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To celebrate, the Atari 2800 team went out after the meeting to celebrate
at Hy's of Canada in Chicago.</font>
