      <div align="center"><big>&nbsp;into a computer keyboard add-on was</big>
      <big>"The Graduate" Computer that was<br>
developed by PVI for Atari and was canceled in the fall of 1983 when<br>
James Morgan took over Atari. &nbsp; &nbsp;However this oddity turned up and
it <br>
appears that Atari was toying around with the idea of either its own<br>
add-on computer system or perhaps this was a possible restyling of<br>
&nbsp;"The Graduate" into a 3/4 sized version of the Atari 2600jr case which<br>
was also being considered for the unreleased "Voice Commander"<br>
module for the Atari 2600 line. &nbsp; &nbsp;This unit is just a mockup, there
are<br>
no internal electronics. &nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully more will come to light on<br>
this rather eye opening find sometime in the future.<br>
