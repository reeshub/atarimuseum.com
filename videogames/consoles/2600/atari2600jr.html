The Atari 2600jr. was the last version of the Video Computer System to
be sold.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was introduced by Atari Corp in 1986.&nbsp;&nbsp;
However the Atari 2600jr. was originally designed in 1983.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Atari 2600jr was codenamed "Bonnie" and was designed to be a joystick-less
version of the Atari CX-2000 "Val" system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Val was to be an
all-in-one low cost Atari 2600 with built in joysticks.&nbsp;&nbsp; However
the joysticks were extremely flimsy and the case design was not as appealing
as many other Atari case designs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 2000 was re-designed
into the Atari 2600jr, basically the same motherboard design, less the
built in joysticks, and also with the cartridge interface on the top of
the unit instead of the rear of the unit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The marketing concept
was simple:&nbsp;&nbsp; Competition in the video game industry was at an
all time high, the Atari 2600jr. would be a simple low cost Atari 2600
packaged with only 1 joystick, no paddle controllers, and 1 game cartridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Packaged into a small "lunch-box" carton, the game system would sell for
about $50.00 and appeal to younger gamers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole
project was placed on hold due to the sale of Atari, Inc. to the Tramiels.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Atari 2600jr. was not released until 1986, most Atari 2600jr's were
sold in a plain brick red/white box design.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>HISTORAL NOTE:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari
2600 case design is the same exact design that was going to be used for
the Atari 2600 Voice Commander Module which was designed by Milton Bradley
for Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit was never released.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari's Mark Biassotti designed the all new hi-tech Atari 2600jr case as
well as the Atari 5100 (Little PAM) case as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Mark's
design, Regan Cheng designed the initial concept of a new low profile Atari
2600jr case, giving it a look very similar to the design of the Atari 1200XL
look.</font>
