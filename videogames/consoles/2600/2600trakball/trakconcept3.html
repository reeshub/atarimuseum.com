<p>Nope, the aliens aren't attacking, its just another example of
<br>a trakball concept design from September 1982.

<p>Now here is one of my favorites, this would have really caught
<br>the attention of a lot of people if this had been the final design
<br>of the Atari Trakball.&nbsp;&nbsp; However as many will surely recognize,
<br>a similar design was used for a 3D virtual reality controller.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="trakconcept10.JPG" height=457 width=350>
<p>Now here is a very realistic design which would have been well
<br>received and would have worked very well, a Trakball stick grip
<br>controller, nice idea and design.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="trakconcept11.JPG" height=457 width=350>
<p>This is the more classic Atari 2700 wedge shaped design, more
<br>of the de facto standard Atari style.
