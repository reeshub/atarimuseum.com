<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us generally are familiar
with the standard Atari CX-80 and CX-22 Trakball controllers which can
be used on any Atari 2600, 7800 and Atari home computer system with a compatible
DB-9 controller port.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari Trakball is a very well
designed and is ergonomically shapped to sit as well on a tabletop or in
a persons laptop for easy use.&nbsp;&nbsp; However most people never get
the opportunity to look at the concept drawings and artwork of an Atari
product as it is being conceived and planned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Below are 15
various concept designs of the Atari trakball up to it's final design.

<p>This Star Trek'ish shuttlecraft looking controller has fire buttons
on either side
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="trakconcept2.JPG" width="350" height="270">
<p>This design has its fire button down low and square which is not a sound
<br>design for ease of use and longterm use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nyko currently
has a similar
<br>looking trakball controller for the Sony Playstation, perhaps their
next
<br>version will be a little more ergonomic.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>This is a progressively more ergonomic design from mid September 1982.
