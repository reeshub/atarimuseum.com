<p>Another of the square shape concepts with fire buttons
<br>towards the front under the Atari logo.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="trakconcept13.JPG" height=457 width=350>
<p>This one looks more like a robot then a trakball, quite
<br>an interesting design though.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="trakconcept14.JPG" height=457 width=350>
<p>No, don't worry its not an Imperial Star Destroyer, just a very
<br>interesting wedge design, not bad either.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="trakconcept15.JPG" height=250 width=375>
<p>This one kind of looks like the Wico controller which came out
<br>a short while after the release of the Atari Trakballs.

<p>The Atari Museum staff hopes you've enjoyed this peak into the past at some of the "Might
Have Been" designs of the Atari home version of the Trakball.&nbsp;&nbsp;
All of the designs shown were drawn by Tom Palecki, formerly of Atari's
Industrial Design group.&nbsp;&nbsp; He now runs his own design company
called Pear Design in California.
