<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spectravideo was one of several manufacturers who
jumped on the "me too" bandwagon when Atari announced it would be producing
a computer keyboard add-on module for its Atari 2600 VCS.&nbsp;&nbsp; However
most of the other manufacturers (Atari included) only got to the prototype
and limited testing phases of their computer keyboards.&nbsp;&nbsp; Spectravideo
on the other hand actually produced and sold (although limited) its computer
keyboard add-on.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Compumate was not only just a computer
add-on, but also was a musical keyboard as well with microphone and earphone
jacks on the side of the unit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the proposed Atari "Graduate"
computer keyboard add-on, the Compumate did not have have any sort of peripheral
add-on capabilities for disk drives or printers, but did allow the connection
of a cassette recorder for taping music and program load/save capability.</B>
