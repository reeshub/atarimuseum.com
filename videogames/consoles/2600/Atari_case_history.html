<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In late 1975, sales of devices that made it
possible for consumers to play Pong on home television sets were booming.
At Atari Inc., which had first introduced Pong as an arcade game and had
manufactured one of the most popular home versions of Pong, engineers began
looking for the next arcade game to put in consumer hands, anticipating
that people would grow tired of two paddles and a ball.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">They saw Jet Fighter and Tank, but instead
of designing a custom chip for each game, as was done for Pong, they planned
a system that would play both games, four-player Pong if anyone was interested,
and possibly a few other, as yet unknown games. The system was to be based
on a microprocessor.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In a few months, Atari's designers in Grass
Valley, Calif., had made a working prototype, and over the next year, designers
from Grass Valley and from Sunnyvale, Calif., refined what was to be the
Atari Video Computer System (VCS). It was released in 1977, and six years
later ranks as one of the most successful microprocessor-based products
ever built, with over 12 million sold at about $140 apiece.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Success did not come without problems.
Production problems in the first two years caused Atari losses estimated
near $25 million. But once these problems were solved and enough software
was developed, the VCS took off.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">It is popular today, not because it does
an admirable job of playing Jet Fighter and Tank, but because its flexible
design also allows it to play chess and baseball, as well as Space Invaders,
Pac-Man and many of the other arcade games that have been i nvented since
the VCS came on the market. More than 200 different game cartridges - the
read-only memories (ROMs) containing VCS software - are now on the market,
manufactured by about 40 companies, and new games are constantly being
developed. An estim ated 120 million cartridges have been sold at prices
from $12 to $35, and the demand is such that, in addition to buying more
6502 microcomputers than anyone else in the world, Atari's purchases of
ROMs for its various divisions is greater than that of al l other companies
in the world combined.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Atari and other video-game companies had
been making microprocessor-based arcade games for some time before the
VCS was developed, but the cost of then-available processors - $100 or
more each - made the idea of a home consumer product based on a micro processor
impractical. Then came Chuck Peddle and the 6502.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. Peddle, who had left Motorola for MOS
Technology after designing the MC6800 microprocessor, appeared at Wescon
- the annual West Coast electronics show - in September 1975, offering
to sell his new microprocessor by the barrel at $8 apiece. "Of co urse,
no one knew that he only had one barrel to his name," recalls Steve Mayer,
cofounder of Cyan Engineering, Atari's private consulting company in Grass
Valley, and now senior vice president for R&amp;D at Atari.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. Mayer and Ron Milner, his colleague
at Cyan, went to see Mr. Peddle at Wescon and found that the 6502 matched
precisely the minimum specifications that they had laid out some time before
in a blue-sky design for a programmable video game. The thre e went into
the back of the MOS Technology suite, Mr. Mayer recalls, and in an hour
the deal was struck. It started a revolution in home video games.</FONT>
<H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">'Trying to survive'</FONT></H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">No one saw it that way at the time. "We were
just trying to survive," Mr. Mayer told <I>Spectrum</I>. Atari had entered
the home video market with a one-chip version of its Pong arcade game,
and it was developing other home video games, but each was based on a single
custom chip that took a year or more and over $100,000 to develop - by
the time an arcade game reached the home market, consumers would have forgotten
about it. A programmable home video game seemed a desirable alternative.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The key to the design was simplicity: making
the software do as much of the work as possible, so that the hardware could
be cheaper - silicon was very expensive in those days. The microprocessor
was synchronized to the television scan rate and created the display one
or two lines at a time. This synchronization reduces memory requirements
for the television interface considerable, but the processor must continually
update the registers in the interface to get any display at all. The program
that fee ds information to the video chip (called Stella, after its designer's
bicycle) is known as a kernel.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">To further reduce memory requirements,
Mr. Mayer and Mr. Milner decided to display the background of the screen
at relatively low resolution, while displaying moving objects with higher
resolution - low-resolution playfield, high-resolution players. T hey also
eliminated any provision for vertical synchronization and gave that task
to the programmer. A VCS kernel must count the number of lines displayed
on the television screen and must finish displaying a single frame in exactly
the same time - 15.24 milliseconds - that it takes the TV set's electron
gun to make a single top-to-bottom sweep.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Two prototypes of the Stella were built:
a functional prototype built by Mr. Milner to test the concept, and a gate-level
prototype built by Joe Decuir, who was hired by Cyan in late 1975. The
gate-level prototype was designed to mimic as closely as p ossible the
intended final chip, using circuit-design techniques specific to MOS integrated
circuits.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">One critical MOS-dependent feature was
the use of a special counter - called a polynomial counter, or pseudorandom
shift register - instead of a true binary counter to determine object positions
on the screen. A polynomial counter occupies one-fourth the silicon area
of an equivalent binary counter, but, unlike a binary counter, it does
not count in any simple order. Thus, a programmer cannot calculate a screen
position for an object and load it into the position counter.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The original Stella prototype had only
one signal to the position counter: a reset that would trigger the immediate
display of an object. Mr. Decuir and Jay Miner, who designed the production
version of the Stella chip, used this same concept in their design. As
a result, displaying an object in a given position on the screen requires
that the programmer count the number of clock cycles taken by a given set
of instruction, figure out how far across the screen the electron beam
would be after the inst ructions had been executed, and act accordingly.
Once the position counter for an object is reset at the proper point, it
continues to display the object at that spot on succeeding lines.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">To move objects, the prototype blocked
out four clock pulses from the position counters during the vertical blanking
interval; a programmer could then add pulses to move an object left or
right - four pulses had to be added to keep the object in the s ame place.
Mr. Miner added a set of motion registers, which add or subtract pulses
automatically when a signal - called H-move - is sent by the microprocessor.
The H-move can be sent during the vertical blanking interval, or during
the horizontal blanki ng interval at the beginning of each line.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">"This seemed innocuous enough," said Larry
Kaplan, the first software designer hired to develop games for the Stella
project. "But I discovered early that it was possible to reposition player
objects during a screen [a frame of the TV picture], though that was not
a consideration of the design."</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">So Mr. Kaplan designed Air-Sea Battle,
which has horizontal bands of player objects, a technique used in countless
VCS games, including Space Invaders, Freeway, Asteroids, and Football.
"Without that single strobe, H-move, the VCS would have died a qu ick death
five years ago," said Mr. Kaplan, now vice president of product development
at Atari.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">H-move and a feature that allowed two or
three copies of an object to be placed on the screen let another VCS programmer,
Rick Mauer, design a home version of the arcade hit, Space Invaders. That
game hit the arcades in 1979, when the VCS was going do wnhill after losing
money in 1977 and 1978.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">"The VCS was not doing that well - there
were only a few million in the field, and it looked like it was dying -
then Space Invaders came out, and bam! it exploded," Mr. Kaplan said. Space
Invaders was the most popular game in the arcades, and the VCS , with rows
of six objects across the screen (two player-objects, copied three times
each) could recreate it in the home.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Another hardware feature, one that actually
cost a fair amount of silicon, was vertical delay, or VDEL. The VCS writes
two television lines at a time, explained Mr. Miner, but shifting objects
by two lines between frames leads to jerky motion. A way had to be found
to shift objects by only one line, and that way was VDEL. Two registers
are used to hold the graphics information for each player-object, and VDEL
selects which register will be displayed on the screen.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The sequence of events is as follows: information
sent to the display registers for one player object is loaded into its
primary register; when information is written to the other player object,
the contents of the primary register for the first objec t are automatically
duplicated in its secondary register; if information for each player object
is written every other scan line, the secondary register selected by VDEL
will display the same shape as the primary register, but one line later.
This technique is now being used to load different information into the
primary and secondary registers of each player object, thus yielding single-line
resolution and other unintended bonuses.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In addition to being able to determine
the shape of an object, programmers can also determine its color and luminance.
The decision to go with both color and luminance registers probably would
not have been made but for the simplicity of the color con trol. Television
color is determined by the difference in phase between the color signal
and a reference signal, or color burst, that is transmitted at the beginning
of each line. The VCS's phase shifter is nothing more than a delay line
tapped at appro priate intervals, and so it occupies fairly little chip
space.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">An example of extensive color manipulation
is a subroutine developed by Mr. Decuir to avoid burning game patterns
onto the TV screen if the VCS is left unattended. The routine, which cycled
through all possible color-luminance combinations, used only a dozen bytes,
a great advantage in early game cartridges, which held only 2 kilobytes
of ROM. "In 2K, you barely have room to brush your teeth," Mr. Decuir said.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">A similar variety of effects was produced
with a minimum of chip space in the sound generator; it contains simply
a few dividers and polynomial counters that can be interconnected in a
number of ways under program control. A 5-bit polynomial counter, Mr. Decuir
noted, produces a low, grumbling sound (used in Tank), and a 9-bit counter
produces a whooshing sound (used in Jet Fighter). The rest of the sounds
that the programmers have made the VCS produce come essentially free, and
they have been extens ive - Mr. Mayer said he has even heard the VCS reproduce
the words "E.T. phone home."</FONT>
<H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Exploiting the hardware</FONT></H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Because the VCS hardware does so little on
its own, a heavy burden is placed on the programmer. But though programming
is arduous, few walls hold back software creativity.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">"Writing the kernels that make up the game
programs," Mr. Mayer said, "is like solving acrostic puzzles with lots
and lots of possibilities. There's a certain class of programmer that can
deal in the microcode like that. If it were easier to program, we wouldn't
have these programmers, because they'd be bored. The VCS is an absolute
challenge."</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">"Another way of saying it is that to deal
with a VCS you have to unlearn every good programming practice you've learned,"
said Mr. Mauer, who designed Space Invaders.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Bob Whitehead, senior designer and cofounder
of Activision Inc. in Mountain View, Calif., may be the most innovative
VCS designer - he is credited with the most firsts in using a new trick.
But he is philosophical about his innovations. "A computer i s a computer,"
he said, "and it only works in one way. If something new comes up, it's
cute, but no more than that, because it's something the computer has always
been able to do; you just didn't discover it before. It's like finding
a penny under the c ouch - it's always been there, but it's cute to discover."</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Once a trick is discovered and is implemented
in a game, it becomes obvious to experienced VCS programmers, Mr. Whitehead
noted, and soon the trick is copied in other games. Less experienced programmers
look at a program listing or pick up tricks by w ord of mouth.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Today, however, designers estimate that
the hardware has been 70 to 80 percent exploited. "More and more the cute
things aren't showing up," Mr. Whitehead said, "but then every time we
discover something new, we think that it is the last thing."</FONT>
<H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Changing displays 'on the fly'</FONT></H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The first trick popped up when Mr. Whitehead
designed Blackjack, and it is now used in nearly every VCS game. It is
the capability to rewrite player objects "on the fly." Because the microprocessor
must feed information every line to the "Stella" chi p to make a display,
it can change the information even during a line to change the appearance
of objects. The hardware can produce multiple copies of a player object
- a feature added so that groups of biplanes could fight each other - and
Mr. Whitehead discovered that he could change the displayed player object
between copies. Instead of putting up three copies of the same object,
the VCS then displays three different objects: three different cards in
the case of Blackjack.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Objects can also be rewritten as they are
repositioned vertically, so the different rows of aliens in Space Invaders
look different. This capability was carried to an extreme in Activision's
Freeway, with 10 lanes of traffic and different cars and tru cks all over
the screen. It was also used very successfully in Asteroids, in which the
rocks that appear to be careening all over the screen are in two rows,
half moving up and half moving down.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">But an initial limitation of rewriting
player objects on the fly was that the copied objects had to move together,
because the VCS produces multiple images only at set spacings. A trick
developed by Mr. Whitehead to allow many graphically different ob jects
to move independently is called flicker.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Flickering displays create the illusion
of extra independent player objects by showing the objects only every other
frame, or every third or fourth frame. The problem with this technique
is that pronounced flicker can make a game difficult or even unp leasant
to play. Judiciously used, this tradeoff can make games possible that the
VCS otherwise could not handle: Starship, in which the stars are made of
player objects that flicker; Adventure, in which flicker occurs only when
there are more than two objects on the screen; baseball and football games;
and Defender, to name a few.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Ironically, flicker has never been used
at Activision, the software company that Mr. Whitehead helped start when
he left Atari in 1979. Mr. Whitehead did not say Activision will never
use the technique in a game, but he noted that the company's progra mmers
will rethink the philosophy of a game to avoid it. "It is a tradeoff that
is not acceptable," he said.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Flicker can be avoided if the motion of
objects is restricted to keep them vertically separated, or by use of more
recent tricks. One of those tricks is "venetian blinds," and it was first
used in Atari's Chess game.</FONT>
<H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Doing the 'impossible': chess</FONT></H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">"When the VCS was first manufactured," Mr.
Kaplan recalled, "the box had a chess piece on it. 'Those marketing guys!
Come on,' we said. 'It'll never do chess.' Well, some guy in Florida sued
because there was a chess piece on the cover and we didn' t have a chess
game."</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">A year later Atari's designers began devloping
Chess. "The guys were playing around," Allan Alcorn, then head of engineering
at Atari, recalled, "and one guy said, 'I could write an algorithm, but
I couldn't get a playfield on the screen.' Another gu y said, 'That's easy.'
" Larry Wagner wrote the algorithm; it took him two years with the help
of national chess champion Julio Kaplan. Mr. Whitehead did the display
in two days, developing the trick now known as venetian blinds [Fig.2].</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">To display eight chess pieces across the
screen (instead of the maximum six possible with triple copies), Mr. Whitehead
displayed each object on every other scan line. On the first sweep across
the screen, graphics for four objects were displayed; on the next sweep,
graphics for the other four were shown. The gaps were obvious, but the
chess pieces were recognizable.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">While primitive in comparison with today's
chess machines, the Wagner-Whitehead chess game, using 4 kilobytes of ROM
and 138 bytes of random-access memory, was as good as the chess machines
then on the market. There was only one problem: the TV screen displayed
random colors while the VCS calculated the next move; no processor time
was left for the screen.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The venetian-blind technique has appeared
in many games since Chess. It was used for horses in Polo, a game by Carol
Shaw that was never released, and in Basic Programming to get 12 characters
on a line. It was also used in Stampede, by Mr. Whitehead , to animate
the animals' legs, and most recently, in Sky Jinks, also by Mr. Whitehead,
where parts of the balloon baskets are displayed on alternate lines. If
used subtly, Mr. Whitehead noted, the technique is hardly noticeable.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">After they had exploited variations on
player graphics, programmers turned to other areas of the Stella chip to
look for tricks. One early discovery was that they could write the playfield
- a low resolution background 40 bits across - on the fly. Al Miller did
this in Surround, where each block in a 40 by 24 grid can be turned on
or off independently. The technique was used by Mr. Whitehead in Chopper
Command to create an extra player object - the chopper the player commands
[Fig. 3].</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. Kaplan first rewrote color on the fly,
changing color line by line to get a figure in his bowling game that has
a flesh-colored head, a blue shirt, gray trousers, and black shoes. That
technique was picked up in Superman to make the cartoon hero's costume
red and blue, and it is used widely to display brightly colored alien attackers,
as well as scenery that appears to recede as the colors deepen - including
sunsets and oceans with rolling waves.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. Whitehead indicated that once a game
is on the market any new tricks used are apparent to experienced programmers.
This thesis was confirmed by <I>Spectrum</I>'s discovery that two techniques
considered trade secrets by Activision at the time of w riting were widely
known and, indeed, used by designers at other video-game companies.</FONT>
<H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Objects that change their size</FONT></H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">One of the tricks designers have pointed out
exploits the capability of the VCS to display an object in normal, double,
or quad width depending upon the rate at which the player register is scanned.
The trick comes in changing the size of the player o bject on the fly.
In Mr. Whitehead's Boxing [Fig. 4], the game in which it is believed this
technique was first used, a change in player size extends the boxer's arm
into a punch. Mr. Whitehead also used the technique in Skiing, and Brad
Stewart at Imag ic has included the trick in his newest game, Sky Patrol.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Another trick first appeared in the game
Dragster. Designer David Crane, known in the industry as "a coding machine,"
wrote an entire kernel on the fly. The code, of course, does not move physically,
but rather moves in time, so that the program is n o longer in synch with
the television set, and what would otherwise be a static display scrolls
horizontally. When Dragster first appeared, the trick was considered impossible
to repeat, but it is now understood throughout the industry. One designer
usi ng it is Imagic's Bob Smith in the game Dragonfire.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Perhaps the ultimate trick is being marketed
by a company called Starpath, in Santa Clara, Calif.: a 6-kilobyte RAM
module that fits into the VCS in place of a cartridge and accepts software
from cassette tapes. (This option had been considered for th e original
VCS but was discarded.) The extended RAM allows programmers to use graphics
tricks that would not fit in the VCS's 128 bytes - consistently finer resolution
and sophisticated rewrite-on-the-fly techniques. Adding RAM to the VCS
is not easy, n or is making cartridges with more than 4 kilobytes of memory.
In order to save money, Atari limited the cartridge connector to 24 pins,
omitting read-write and clock lines for RAM, as well as lines for addresses
greater than 4096. Mr. Miner and Mr. Decu ir agreed in retrospect that
this decision was a mistake, since a 30-pin connector would have cost only
50 cents for each VCS and 10 cents a cartridge and would have allowed both
RAM and a 64-kilobyte address space.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Many companies now use 8-kilobyte cartridges
by means of a technique called bank switching, where a read from a certain
address triggers a flip-flop, directing all subsequent addresses to a different
section of memory. The first bank-switched cartridg e was a 6-kilobyte
chess game by Larry Wagner; the game was "scrunched" to kilobytes by Bob
Whitehead, eliminating the need for bank switching, before it was marketed.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">RAM in cartridges is made possible by resynthesizing
clock signals for RAM from those timing lines that do find their way to
the cartridge port. The increased speed of instructions dealing with the
first 256 bytes of memory by the 6502 is all that mak es the VCS possible,
and so the VCS uses similar techniques internally to conserve address space.
A read and a write call to the same address may deal with two completely
separate registers, Mr. Miner noted: the read-write line is actually being
used as another address line, in addition to its intended purpose.</FONT>
<H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Making the hardware work</FONT></H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The VCS design, it sometimes seems, affords
nearly limitless possibilities for programmers. But the basic design of
the machine did not come easy. The MOS layout was done directly on the
screen of an automated IC drafting system, and circuit analysis was performed
without sophisticated tools. Mr. Miner recalled simply counting the maximum
number of gate delays in any line, adding the line delays, and multiplying
by two for a safety factor. The first pass of silicon failed, he noted,
because "there was one line that didn't go into the flip-flop I thought
it did; it went around it through 12 more gates. That was twice as many
gates as any other line."</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The VCS was also a near nightmare to produce,
according to the people involved. For example, the mechanical design specified
two sizes of self-tapping screw, and few workers on the production line
could distinguish between the two. If the wrong screw was used, it shaved
out myriad metal filings that raised havoc with the interior circuitry.
Further, when unassembled cases were stored for a time, the plastic would
warp, and the two halves would not longer fit together. Production workers
learned the "VCS karate chop" to pop the cases together.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">But if production problems were not enough,
the VCS also had testing problems because so few of its internal states
were accessible: instructions came in from the cartridge, and composite
video came out through the television jack. Digital testers cou ld not
deal with the video signals, and analog testers were not sufficiently programmable,
recalled Mr. Mayer, noting that Atari had not faced such problems before,
because "we'd never built anything with more than one custom IC in it."</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The inability to test sufficiently cost
Atari millions of dollars in the first year of production when one of its
suppliers had process problems but the chips still passed incoming inspection.
The chips were fast enough to make Atari's test software r ate them as
acceptable, but not fast enough to function properly when placed in an
assembled VCS.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">While the process problems were being resolved,
Atari instituted a test program based on visual inspection of the final
product: a test cartridge was developed, and inspectors would plug it in,
plug in simulated controllers, and watch 20 seconds or so of "game" on
a TV set to determine if each VCS were working.</FONT>
<H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Market acceptance</FONT></H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Even though Atari was late delivering the
VCS to retailers for the 1977 Christmas season, its sales volume went from
$60 million to $120 million that year. Still, the company lost money. In
1978 Atari decided to build 800,000 VCS machines, more than twice as many
as the year before. A total of 500,000 orders came in by late summer, and
after fall shipments went out, they disappeared from retailers' shelves
in a few weeks. But few additional orders came, and Atari was left with
300,000 unsold machin es; the company had doubled its sales volume for
the second year in a row, Mr. Decuir recalls, and still it lost money.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Warner Communications Inc., New York, had
bought Atari for $28 million in 1976, largely on the strength of expectations
for the VCS. But "for two years," Mr. Mayer recalled, "Atari managed to
single-handedly drag down the return on equity of Warner st ock by a significant
amount." Today, thanks largely to the success of the VCS, Atari is responsible
for over half of Warner's total profit.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Messrs. Mayer, Milner, Miner, and Decuir
set out to make a simple consumer product that would sell for two or three
years - slightly longer than a dedicated game. By creating a machine with
an elegant architecture that left all its inner workings acce ssible to
the programmer, they ended up - as did early manufacturers of phonographs
- creating an industry, one that today has over 70 companies competing
for a share of the video-game software market, estimated this year at $2.4
billion.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Comparing the hardware</FONT></H3>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Many companies have tried to market programmable
video-game machines, starting with Fairchild's Channel F in 1976. Most
of these machines - including the Fairchild - have sold poorly. The four
programmable video-game units currently in demand are Ata ri Inc.'s Video
Computer System (VCS), Mattel Electronics' Intellivision, Magnavox's Odyssey
2, and ColecoVision, from Coleco Industries.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The Intellivision is the VCS's major competitor.
Because it has far more random-access memory than the VCS, it can display
an entire television frame without help from its processor - in fact, it
must do so, because the processor can communicate with the video chip only
during the vertical blanking interval.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The Intellivision display has a background
made up of a 20-by-12-"card" array, with the cards' content specified by
the programmer. With a "character set" of different shapes, a designer
can build up quite detailed scenes. However, because the proces sor cannot
talk to the video chip while the display is being formed, line-by-line
changes of background or moving objects are impossible. Two or more of
the Intellivision's eight moving objects must be superimposed to get multiple
colors. Furthermore, p layer objects cannot be used again in the same frame,
thus lessening the advantage that eight player objects give the Intellivision
over the VCS, which has only two.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The Intellivision's forte, according to
industry observers, is games with detailed but static displays. However,
the speed of moving objects is entirely under the control of the programmer,
since the hardware supports fast motion as least as well as t he VCS.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">"Mattel is the victim of realism," said
one hardware designer at Mattel. "Its games are slow because people try
to make them like the real world, and it takes time to move from one end
of a football field to the other."</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Sports and strategy games are well served
by the Intellivision controller, which combines a keypad with directional
controls and action buttons, as opposed to Atari's one-button joystick.
On the other hand, some contend that the controller may be diff icult to
use.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Although the Intellivision's inflexibility
is counterbalanced by its great power, the Odyssey 2 does not fare as well
in the estimation of those who have examined it: "It is weak in everything,"
said Rober Ogden, president of Action Graphics, a freelan ce game company
in Carey, Ill. David Johnson, an Imagic game designer who works with the
Odyssey 2, said that it was a more primitive game machine. It has only
eight colors, compared with Intellivision's 16 and the VCS's 128 (16 colors
and eight luminan ces). Its four movable objects have only half the resolution
of objects on either the VCS or the Intellivision. The objects have only
a single color, as do Intellivision objects, and can be reused only if
the display is blanked completely while they are being rewritten.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">One advantage that the Odyssey 2 has over
other machines is its full keyboard and character generator, so that letters
or parts of them can be placed anywhere on the screen. However, it makes
no other provision for background, except for a very low-re solution grid,
not used by most designers. The microprocessor, an 8048, is described by
Mr. Johnson as not well suited to videogames because it is slow and has
an inefficient instruction set.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Sound generation is very difficult on the
Odyssey 2, and very crude, since it has only one sound channel. The VCS
has two sound channels, which programmers have pushed to get a wide variety
of sounds. And far more complex sound can be generated with the Intellivision,
which has three sound channels in a separate, programmable chip. The overall
Odyssey 2 system, said Mr. Johnson, "has a number of unusual features,
almost all of them disadvantageous." However, a fair number of the machines
have been sold, and the production of games for the Odyssey 2 by independent
software companies indicates that the machine is established.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The VCS and Odyssey 2 are considered first-generation
machines, the Intellivision a second-generation unit. ColecoVision marks
the third generation of programmable video games. Its background display
has better resolution than do the moving objects o f the other systems
and both objects and background can change color on a pixel-by-pixel as
well as line-by-line basis. To do this, the machine uses 16 kilobytes of
RAM devoted to the display, and game play uses another kilobyte, compared
with 128 bytes of RAM for the VCS and about 3 kilobytes for the Intellivision.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Coleco also sells an adapter to allow its
unit to play Atari-compatible cartridges. A lawsuit is pending over this,
as Atari holds patents it claims cover certain parts of the VCS, including
the polynomial counters used to position players on the scre en, and certain
elements of the VCS's sound generator. Coleco said it "does not infringe
any valid patent."</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Other third-generation machines may be
on the way. Mattel has shown its distributors prototypes of the Intellivision
III, which has vastly improved graphics and sound, as well as wireless
controllers that use infrared-emitting diodes. Commodore is st ill promising
to release its Max game machine, which could theoretically put more than
256 moving objects on the screen at the same time.</FONT>
