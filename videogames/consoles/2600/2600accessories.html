<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari knew that providing
its customers with every type of accessory possible for the Atari 2600
VCS would increase not just its popularity since users could go out and
accessorize till they dropped, but it increased visibility in stores and
increased revenues.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari attempted to provide all sorts of
organizers, cartridge holders, controllers, and any other items and accessories
it felt that users would want and need.

<p>The Modular cartridge library could be mounted on a wall or placed on
a table top.
<br>Its modular design allowed an unlimited amount of modules to connect
<br>together and form a large cartridge library organizer.

<p>The Game Library was a single standalone organizer that could hold up
<br>eight (8) Atari 2600 game cartridges and their manuals.&nbsp; With
te push
<br>of a button above each cartridge it would pop-out.&nbsp; Model ORG-300.

<p>This cartridge holder was a nice concept.&nbsp;&nbsp; It held up to
eight (8)
<br>Atari 2600 cartridges (a version in dark grey was also made to
<br>hold Atari computer cartidges as well).&nbsp; It was supplied with
a
<br>set of labels for the currently available Atari 2600 games which
<br>you could place on the binder side of the case and you could
<br>store you cartridges in a bookshelf styled fashion.
