Another superb home version of the trakball.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again Dan
Kramer and Levon Mitchell did the electro-mechanicals on this controller
and also did a special version (the Dan-Levon version :-) for the Atari
home computers that when used with Missle Command and press CTRL-T would
put the game into a true Trakball mode and allow the game to be played
perfectly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there was one thing Atari knew how to do
well for its home console, then designing and selling Trakballs was definitely
one of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trakball, although originally designed for
the Atari 2600, could also be used on the Atari 400/800, XL/XE computers
and also the Atari 7800 PROsystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two version were available,
the CX-80 (shown above) and the CX-22 with selector switch to go from joystick
to trakball mode.</font></font>
