Originally called Arcadia, then renamed to StarPath, the Supercharger was
an exceptionally powerful add-on module for the Atari 2600 VCS.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It added 6K of additional memory and a tape cassette interface for loading
in various game tapes (7 tapes in total were released officially).&nbsp;&nbsp;
The system was designed by Bob Brown who was a former Atari, Inc engineer
(also responsible for the Atari Video Music).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Superchargers
increased memory capabilities allowed the Atari 2600 to play games that
in the past were unachievable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Game such as Escape from the
Mindmaster had first person 3D maze effects, even the pack-in game "Phaser
Patrol" was a superior space game compared with other games available on
the Atari 2600.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Supercharger came
packaged with Game #1: Phaser Patrol, the following games were sold seperately:</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2. Communist Mutants From Space</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">3. FireBall</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">4. Suicide Mission</font>
