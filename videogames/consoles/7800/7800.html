<p><img SRC="7800_84_box.jpg" BORDER=0 align=LEFT width="450" height="317"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The
Atari 7800 ProSystem was Atari's chance at redemption in the video game
market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari Inc. spent a good part of 1983 interviewing
thousands of people on what they wanted&nbsp; and didn't want in a video
game console.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari Inc. through Warner Communications, then worked with General Computer
Corporation who earlier had lost a lawsuit with Atari regarding a "Speed-up"
board for Atari's Missile Command.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Art Ng, Steve Golson and several of GCC's Chip Architect
Designers with assistance from VLSI&nbsp; would architect and design the
GCC1702B "MARIA" Graphics Processor, the heart of the Atari 7800 ProSystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The first MARIA chip was numbered
GCC1701.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GCC's engineers were big fans of Star Trek, so with
the Enterprise being NCC-1701, they made their chip the GCC-1701.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The final production chip: Maria II was GCC1702B.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
The all new graphics chip called MARIA (Also the codename of the 7800 Project)
with almost 100 independent sprites, better color palette onscreen, and
other powerful features would not only allow game designers the ability
to code new and exciting games, but the chip also allowed an original Atari
TIA processor to co-exist side by side with MARIA so that the new console
could also play all of the original Atari 2600 games as well.</font>

as an added bonus, GCC's programmers&nbsp; would also do almost all of
the Atari 2600, 5200</font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">and Atari 8-bit computer games in 1983-1984
for Atari.&nbsp; Atari's programmers in Sunnyvale were jumping ship to start
  their own firms. After another batch left to start Imagic, another group
  threaten to leave Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve Ross, head of Warner
  Communications contacted GCC about doing games for Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only
  was GCC able to code games for Atari's console, they were doing it in weeks
  compared to months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warner started to call GCC
  &quot;The Toaster&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Just pop in the game spec's and out
  popped a finished game.)&nbsp;</font>
  <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The
Atari 7800 was designed to be flexible and expandable and even had</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">an expansion port for future peripherals
to tap into the system bus and video circuitry.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 7800 ProSystem was
  the ultimate video game console creation,
a console with features everyone wanted.</font>&nbsp; <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Gone were the complex 5200 type controllers,
in came a clean and simple ProController, out</font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">went the HUGE size of the 5200 and in
came a small and sleek console design.</font></div>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; Within Atari, Inc. from
1983-1984 The Atari 3600 (as the Atari 7800 was called for the first several
months</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of the project) was stated as "Company
#1 Priority" and in many Atari Engineering Log Books its noted:</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"3600 System takes precedence over Atari
1400/1450 project."&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically Atari was putting everything
and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">everyone into the 7800 to make it a winner.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To make sure the system had every bell and whistle possible,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the system was slated to be released with
not only a computer keyboard, but also a High Score cartridge</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(Designed by GCC), and a new add-on module
for the Atari 5200 called The "Slam-Pam" which would</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">have given the Atari 5200 system full
Atari 7800/2600 compatibility to ensure its existing base of 5200</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">owners could immediately take advantage
of all the hot new games that the 7800 was capable of producing</font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">added an encryption key system into its

<p><img SRC="7800proline.jpg" align=LEFT width="350" height="221"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When
Atari was sold to the Tramiels in 1984, the last the thing the Tramiels
had on their minds was selling video games.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Atari and
Warner had committed to the obligation to GCC for the Atari 7800 and its
games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reluctantly Jack Tramiel paid a one time &quot;Go
away&quot; amount to GCC, who cashed that check immediately before it
bounced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 7800 was left to be shelved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Earlier in the Spring of 1983 Nintendo
approached Atari to license and sell their Famicom system
under the Atari name since Nintendo didn't feel it could compete against
the once mighty video game giant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In August of 1983, Ray
Kassar was let go as Atari's CEO, in the upper management shuffle, the Nintendo
deal slipped through the cracks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Becoming impatient,&nbsp;
Nintendo decided that they would sell their Famicom in the U.S. on their own and called
it The "Nintendo Entertainment System"&nbsp;&nbsp; Released in 1985 it was an instant selling success.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari Corp, seeing the sudden resurgence in the video game market decided
it was time to pull the finished 2600jr that Atari, Inc. under Warner Comm.
had developed in 1983 out of mothballs and take the Atari 7800's which
were also completed and sitting around for more then&nbsp; 2 years off
the shelf and sell them in 1986.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it was too
little, too late.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nintendo had the market; lock, stock and
barrel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to mention Sega with its Master System was
also hot in Nintendo's tail, Atari was running third in a race it used
to run a far lead in first in the past.</font>
