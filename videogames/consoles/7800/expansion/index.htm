        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        7800 Expansion Module has been moving at a remarkably fast pace given 
        this is a hobbyist driven product.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving into 
        the highly ambitious position of actually producing new, from the ground 
        up custom plastic case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as 1984 inspired 
        Box Design, the 7800 Expansion Module brings the true spirit and life of 
        what Atari products used to be like when they were original produced and 
        sold...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">So on <b>September 30th</b>, 
        the project was kicked off officially and work began...</font></p>
        <p>
        <font face="Arial">

        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">One very important feature of the 
        Expansion Module was the complete re-design of the High Score cartridge 
        design done by GCC in 1984.&nbsp;&nbsp; The original reproductions stuck 
        precisely to the design for historical accuracy sake, but they came with 
        the inherent battery drain flaw as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was 
        time to do a new High Score design and eliminate any battery.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Instead scores would be retained in a non-volatile RAM chip (nvRAM).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        A new design was created and 8 original 7800 High Score cartridges were 
        modified and thoroughly tested.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On <b>
        November 16th</b> the design moved onto the Expansion Module PC Board 
        layout and those test carts were then made available for sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Upgrades will be offered to existing High Score cartridge owners after 
        the 7800 Expansion Modules have been shipped.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="hsc78nv.jpg" width="376" height="431"></font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">On <b>November 23rd</b> 
        the dream of creating brand new plastics for an Atari product, based on 
        prototype designs done back in 1984 were realized when the shipment of 
        plastic shells for the 7800 Expansion Module arrived...</font></p>
        <p align="center">
        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="7800exp2.jpg" width="474" height="358"></font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Meanwhile, the <b>Nov 30th</b> 
        deadline loomed. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still much work needed to 
        be completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC Boards still had to have some 
        redesigns and several components were falling very far behind schedule 
        from the vendors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">By <b>December 10th</b> is was becoming 
        apparent that&nbsp; 2010 was going to have to pass by without the 7800 
        Expansion Modules making it out the door, too many unfinished items were 
        left:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Aluminum name plates - truly one 
        of 
        the key cosmetic parts of the project just weren't materializing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The S. Carolina firm 
        kept falling behind and so much relied on receiving the nameplates - 
        especially have the final box art shots taken and for the cover the 
        Owners Manual which were completed except for the Cover Page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Plus assembly of the units with the plates.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>December 23-January 7.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        While on vacation, a new nameplate company was hired and the files sent 
        to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The California firm has been hit with hard times 
        and they were willing to work hard to get the project done in 2 weeks to 
        ship out to us.&nbsp;&nbsp; So on January 7th the Purchase Order 
        contract was signed and we are moving forward with them and with a lot 
        more confidence in them delivering the same Diamond cut appearance and 
        rainbow stripe silk screening, so quality will be maintained to its 
        highest level.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Once the plates are received, the 
        Box Art and Manual's can head to the printers with an expected 
        completion time of 7-10 days afterwards.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>January 9th.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile PC Board work has gone 
        into high gear, many changes have been made to the design to take it 
        from its TTL design that it was going to for speed sake, but now headed 
        back to a CPLD design because of the issues with Fine Scrolling 
        enhancements, so &quot;Opcode&quot; has been asked to complete the CPLD design as 
        original spec'd...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Groovybee&quot; is also hard at work on 
        a more robust onboard firmware to correct High Score Cart memory 
        conflict issues and have a more intelligent cartridge type sensing 
        routine.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">If all of the PC Board work can be 
        completed within 5-10 days, the PC Boards can be immediately run and 
        will be assembled, tested and shipped in a stream to get the 7800 XM's 
        out the door as quickly as possible.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>January 26th.</b>&nbsp; 
        Nameplates have arrived, big hurdle has finally been overcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Working on box artwork today and will submit to the printer tomorrow, 
        they said 7-10 business days to complete and will ship out from CA. to 
        us here in NY, so should be 3 days or so for shipping, we should be 
        around Feb 10th to receive the boxes and start packing things up to 
        begin initial shipments.</font></p>

        our team had to move onto other personal matters so things slowed down 
        on the main controller chip within the system, which is now codenamed 
        project &quot;MILO&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>March 15th.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Okay we are now on an Atmel 1504 CPLD chip, the board has to go back for 
        a nearly complete redesign due to space issues and changes into the 
        control IC and also with the implementation of a more intelligent BIOS 
        system onboard, rev 1.03f is in testing, new CPLD has been upgraded from 
        a 44pin version up to a 68pin version because we have a LOT more control 
        select logic going on and also the implementation of a Scroll Assist 
        circuit which Steve Golson, one of the original architects of the 7800 
        MARIA chip has reviewed over.</font></p>

        Bee) for BIOS implementation in realtime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Notices went out to the first round of buyers for a May 5th ship, going 
        to 
        push that back a week, still see if we can start to get a few units 
        trickling out to the first buyers and then start to kick things up and

        Still working out a lot of design and functionality issues that are 
        still cropping up and making this final stretch a bit irritating.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The only good side is everyone has been great about the delays and not 
        pressuring to get it released faster then it can be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Got an interesting email over the Memorial Day weekend which I thought 
        was kind of interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone asked how new 7800 
        cartridge connectors could possibly be made, were they just poured resin 
        replica's, no they are newly made ones, here are the original 1984 
        mechanical drawings and some shots of the Solidworks 3D CAD files.</font></p>

      want people to have problems with the XM, especially where they would have 
      to take the unit off each time they'd want to use a specific game because 
      of conflict or compatibility issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea is to install 
      this and never have to remove it except in very rare circumstances as 
      described in the above video where a few cart cases, even with the wider

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry for the delay, been sick past week with the 
      flu and only have been on here and there sporadically.&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling 
      a lot better tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark sent me over the demo video of the 
      XEGS keyboard test.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I designed the XM 
      to have a keyboard port, I decided the best option would be to use 
      something already in existence that should be fairly easy to obtain for 
      most people, so the XEGS keyboard seemed like the best option to go with 
      and that was what I incorporated into the design.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">To be honest, I never really thought I'd even be 
      discussing the keyboard until months after the release of the XM and then 
      people would start to get curious about using the keyboard port.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      However, thanks to Mark, he found that my keyboard port needed some 
      changes to it and he decided to write some test code to allow the keyboard 
      to talk to the BIOS test program (and hence its ability to talk with any 
      7800 program that will be coded to use it) and now we actually have a demo 
      of the keyboard working.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was as much a surprise to me the 
      day I received a BIOS update and wired up the changes to the hardware as 
      anyone else.&nbsp; So enjoy this short demo that again, shows the future 
      potential for the 7800 is wide open thanks to the XM and its expansion 
      ports.</font></p>

      been THAT long ?!?!?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the new 84 pin CPLD 
      design is done, some audio issues have been addressed, we now have a bus 
      divider into the design, a reset circuit, test circuit and the SIO has 
      been fully implemented with lines to a PIA footprint that people can add 
      on, plus there are experimenter points along the PIA for those who want to 
      tinker further.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just shaking out and debugging all the 
      major design changes, if all looks good, Mark is going to squeeze one last 
      bit of features into the PLD code that he's been holding onto until we 
      knew all of the remaining core functionality was implemented.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Okay, now for some fun stuff and 
      this is really cool....&nbsp;&nbsp; have a listen to this audio, this is a

      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">------------------------ <br>
      This sound sample was done with some code I'm working on for my Digdug 
      sound upgrade. Groovybee was kind enough to help me test and debug it on 
      his XM setup. The Pac-man sound data (notes and instruments) for the

      the Sharp X68000 computer. <br>

      </b>I mentioned that with the book project behind me, I'm back working 
      with Mark on some open issues.&nbsp; I noticed on Atariage a few people 
      suggested &quot;Just ship the damned thing as is to save your reputation&quot;&nbsp; 
      Mark and I can't and won't do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some 
      show-stopper items that are left open to implement and to just say, I'm 
      done, lets go to assembly right now would mean 250 units would ship and 
      there would be problems and they'd all have to come back for modifications 
      and patches and that would be a logistical nightmare for all.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">I think its important for everyone 
      to understand, basically the design was scrapped and restarted 3 times, we 
      are on Rev 3.1-&quot;X&quot; of the design, it is a COMPLETELY different design from 
      the past two, the system has been partitioned with bus dividers, the 
      addressing and function calls have been changed and expanded, we tried to 
      incorporate Xboard compatibility, we had to redo the whole audio section 
      to also allow existing POKEY equipped carts to work, the SIO interfacing 
      was changed from being a very bare bones implementation to a fully capable 
      design, the PIA option has been added for that as well, and some test 
      point and hacker points have been added.&nbsp; The BIOS is field updatable 
      and the list goes on...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">I actually had to sit down and spend 
      about 3-4 days just completely refamiliarizing myself with the whole 
      design again and go through my notes so I can get back to where things 
      left off.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going through a bullet point list of to-do's and 
      changes now on one of three sheets and I'm hoping in the next couple of 
      days to pass things by Mark to make sure we are both back in sync, we also 
      need to test out the new 84 pin CPLD design and Mark has been secretly 
      coding some extremely incredible demo's of the scrolling capability of the 
      new system.&nbsp; Everyone has been exceptionally patient and gracious 
      through all these bumps and tons of delays, and I know I had to take a 6 
      month complete hiatus from this project for the Atari book, but I am 
      solely back on this.&nbsp; I actually have a whole new USB joystick/paddle 
      project as well as a new arcade interface project, both are totally 
      sitting to the side until the XM is done, this is my only focus now.</font></p>

      fight it off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark was pre-occupied a bit with a 
      personal project of his which is now been made public, he took my Atari ST 
      Star Raiders source code and ported it over to the Jag64, certainly an 
      interesting turn of events.&nbsp; Okay well back to the board, I've 
      printed out the top and bottom layers and I'm running through visual

      Okay, just spoke with Mark on a bunch of things, last 2 1/2 weeks were 
      completely lost due to Hurricane Sandy and then the Nor'easter that hit.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Office power was down for a while, some minor damage to the roof and looks 
      like I've got 2 leaks coming into the workshop downstairs, but fortunately 
      its on the opposite side of the shop so all of the boxes of XM cases, 
      cartridge parts and other things never were in trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      Legacyengineer.com server is down however, so I am working to try and get 
      things fixed with that.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I'm trying to get things back on 
      track again and need some comments back from Mark this coming weekend, so 
      I'll get another update up early next week.</font></p>

      further compatibility with any further games, the design is locked down

      build XM's.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should be able to do 5-6 daily and get them out 
      to first ordered first and go through the list.&nbsp; I will email people 
      in batches to verify addresses, if I don't get a reply back, they get

      For those who may not frequent the Atari 7800 forums on atariage.com I had 
      posted an announcement to everything.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been in the 
      hospital for several weeks due to congestive heart failure and tissue 
      fluid overload which nearly brought my heart to a standstill as it was so 
      overloaded with fluid it nearly couldn't beat properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've 
      got a severely leaky mitral valve once again and I am awaiting a decision 
      from the heart surgeons n their plan for me as this would be my 4th heart 
      surgery and the risk is very high so they are looking at ways of operating 
      on my by going up through my groin and doing the surgery in a non-invasive 
      manner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless to say I have been unable to do any work on 
      the XM's and I am hoping to have my surgery by mid-Jan and then spend a 
      few weeks recovering, so I can't put a firm date when I can complete the 
      XM's to ship out at this point until I can gauge my recovery and know when 
      I can return to my office to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now, my best estimate 
      is perhaps end of March, I'm very sorry for yet another delay, but this is 
      certainly not something I anticipated nor can do much to change.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b><font size="5">May 27th</font></b><font size="5">
      </font>- As most have heard, I'm finally feeling better and I've gone back to 
      work on the XM, sadly my partner on this project - Mark (Groovybee) has 
      moved onto some other work and is no longer involved in the XM it would 
      seem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark has been great, he's been a real champion in 
      helping on this project, but it has been a very long process and we all do 
      these things for the love of the hobby, no one is obligated to stay on a 
      project.&nbsp;&nbsp; However the Rev 3 design was based on idea's and 
      features Marked wanted to incorporate into the XM design, and the BIOS is 
      all Mark's work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without Mark's involvement I cannot implement 
      the logic he wanted to put into the design since I don't know what he 
      wanted to lay it out as nor where he wished to tie in. Also some of the 
      features may have required  a further modified BIOS to support these 
      features.&nbsp; I am not a 7800 Coder and I can't write the BIOS.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Mark also has all of the sources to the BIOS so I couldn't alter it 
      anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I have decided on a compromise - I am going to take 
      many of the benefits from the Rev 3 designs, go back to the Rev 2 which 
      was a working platform and incorporate those Rev 3 improvements where 
      feasible and then use the last stable BIOS Mark had delivered for the 
      project and put everything together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perry has a friend who is 
      an Analog Audio guy looking over the Yamaha portion of the XM schematics 
      to see if he can fix some of the shortcomings with the design.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">So basically the final design will 
      be a Rev 2.5 design.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've also decided that once the XM's are 
      released I am putting all of the schematics into PD so those who'd like to 
      tinker, hack and improve upon the XM design.&nbsp; Perhaps if Mark decides 
      to get back involved in 7800 development at a later time, maybe he will 
      release the BIOS as PD, but that is solely his decision and I would 
      respect either way he would wish to go with that.&nbsp; My releasing of 
      the schematics doesn't obligate him to release his BIOS.&nbsp;&nbsp; So 
      I've started working on wedging the 68Pin 1504AS back into the Rev 3 
      boards, and re-routing the traces and removing all of the additional Bus 
      partitioning and secondary Address Bus lines out of the design and getting 
      to a Rev 2.5 'Hybrid' design which will be functional and do what was 
      initially intended before feature-creep added to the design. </font></p>

      original Arcade version.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been given the opportunity to 
      watch the conversations between them and the level of meticulousness is 
      incredible.&nbsp; This game does NOT disappoint.</font></p>
