					<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The 7800 XM (eXpansion 
Module) is a plug in device that is installed into the top cartridge slot of any 
Atari 7800 console.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once installed this intelligent device will 
detect whether Atari 2600 or Atari 7800 cartridges are installed into it.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If an Atari 2600 cartridge is installed, the Atari 7800XM goes into a disabled 
mode so it just acts as a pass through device and does not interfere with Atari 
2600 cartridges and their functions.&nbsp;&nbsp; If an Atari 7800 compatible 
cartridge is installed into it, it will check the cartridge and detect if it is 
PAL or NTSC and then it will check if it has an onboard POKEY chip.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Depending on the type of cartridge and whether it is equipped with its own 
onboard POKEY chip, the 7800XM will configure itself accordingly to work with 
that type of game.</font></p>

					<p align="justify"><b>
                    <font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="5">What features does the 
7800XM have?</font></b></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The 7800XM was designed to be 
a device that could've been made in the 1984-1992 era by Atari, so it only uses 
devices that could've existed at the time to keep the console as true to form as 
possible.&nbsp;
</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>
                    <font size="5">1.</font></b> The 7800XM comes with onboard 
High Score keeping, a design which was originally done by GCC (the designers of 
the 7800) but this feature was canceled when the Atari 7800 was released.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
9 of the original 10 games that GCC wrote for Atari have high score keeping 
functions built into them so they automatically work with this feature.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Numerous homebrew games have also been released with high score keeping code in 
them, so they too work with this feature.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>
                    <font size="5">2</font></b>. The 7800XM also has 128K of 
onboard, game usable memory to greatly enhance and improve games that will be 
written to take advantage of this additional memory.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>
                    <font size="5">3.</font></b> The 7800XM has an onboard 
POKEY audio processor chip, giving games the same high quality 4 channel sounds 
that the Atari computers and Atari 5200 enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many games have 
already been coded to use the POKEY chip when detected, so they will 
automatically use this audio processor when they are plugged into the XM.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Also the XM can detect is a cartridge, such as Ball Blazer, already has an 
onboard POKEY chip inside of it and the XM will then disable its own POKEY chip 
and just pass through the audio from the POKEY chip in the cartridge.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>
                    <font size="5">4.</font></b> Another feature from the 
POKEY chip in the XM is it is connected to a 15 pin keyboard port that is Atari 
XEGS keyboard compatible.&nbsp; This will allow more complex games with keyboard 
input to use a keyboard for game play.&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael St. Pierre, the 
famous designer of the TransKey interface that allowed IBM keyboards to be used 
on Atari home computers has released a plug in interface for the XEGS port that 
allows IBM PC keyboards to work, this has been tested with the 7800XM and is 
100% compatible.</font></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>
                    <font size="5">5.</font></b> With the 7800XM you get not 
one, but two audio processors.&nbsp;&nbsp; A Yamaha 2151 audio synthesiser chip 
is also onboard the 7800XM.&nbsp; This chip was used in several Atari coin-op 
games such as Marble Madness and the quality of the audio from this chip is 
truly breath taking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The possibilities of releasing Atari 7800 
games with audio from this chip will completely change the way people view the 
Atari 7800.</font></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>
                    <font size="5">6.</font></b> The 7800XM also has an SIO 
port, it is connected to the POKEY chip and has basic functions, to give the 
7800XM full SIO peripheral capabilities there is a footprint inside of the 
7800XM where hardware hackers and modders can add a PIA or can experiment and 
try expanding the 7800XM's capabilities even further.</font></p>

					<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>
                    <font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Is the 7800XM 
                    hard to install? </font></b></p>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>
                    <font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="5">What tools do I 
                    need?</font></b></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The 7800XM is as easy to 
install as plugging a cartridge into your Atari 7800, it just plugged right on 
top, no tools, soldering or any modifications to the 7800 console.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Just plug and play.</font></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><b>
                    <font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Does the 7800XM make  my existing games better?</font></b></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">No, the existing games do not 
change, only games that have code in them to access features of the 7800XM will 
become more enhanced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some current games play regular Atari 2600 
audio, but have code that if they detect a POKEY chip, they play all their 
sounds in POKEY audio.&nbsp; Games that have high score code play normal, but 
when they detect High Score keeping, they bring up a high score save screen and 
a list of the latest high scores.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other games may be XM only games 
because they may be coded to only work with the XM RAM or other features, so you 
will have to check with the home brewer and read the information on a 7800 game 
to make sure that it isn't an XM ONLY game.</font></p>

                    <font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">March 2020: Developer 
					units have been shipped out to coders in the Atari community 
					who are actively working on updating existing games and 
					working on new ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are also reporting any 
					final bugs and/or issues with the XM's so that the final End 
					User versions can be readied.&nbsp; The End User BIOS is 
					being written now and once its fully tested and all of the 
					final features are unlocked in it, then the End user units 
					will ship out.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has been a HUGE step forward 
					this year.&nbsp; Its taken 10 years of dealing with life 
					threatening health issues, the loss of some team members and 
					trying to overcome major obstacles with getting this device 
					to work in a stable and reliable manner on a great system, 
					but one with many variations and inconsistencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					But now things have moved to the point where these are now 
					in the hands of people and they are finally getting to work 
					with the XM's at last.</font></p>
