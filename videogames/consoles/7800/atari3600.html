The original model # of the Atari 7800 was the Atari 3600.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Marketing then settled on the Atari CX-9000 Video Computer System.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since the system was originally thought to be the ultimate gaming console,
a high number was chosen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then during marketing meetings
it was realized that there would be more powerful game consoles down the
road so the model # was reconsidered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was decided
that the new console would have the model # 7800 (5200 Graphics + 2600
Compatibility = 7800)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it would utilize the new
line of PRO-LINE controllers, it would be called the PROSystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Atari 7800 PRO System was born.</font>

The original Atari 3600 prototype was going to be a single sided motherboard
to drastically cost reduce the unit from the start to help increase profits.&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, all of the jumpers on the top of the motherboard proved to be
anything but a cut in cost.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be too costly to assemble
and the single sided PCB was dropped in favor of a new PCB which was double
sided.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many have asked, "why isn't there a POKEY
chip on the motherboard?!?!&nbsp;&nbsp; All the 7800 will do is 2600 type
audio!!!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, due to the size of the case (the Atari
7800 case is actually a re-designed version of the Atari 2800.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The re-design was done by Barney Huang) the motheboard of the Atari 7800
was rather small and there was not enough space to accomodate the POKEY
chip into the design.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead the POKEY chip could be added
into the game cartridges themselves when higher quality sound effects were
needed (Such as the Ball Blazer cartridge with its background music.)</font>
