        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">The
        Atari 7800 ProSystem was Atari's chance at redemption in the video game 
		market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari Inc. spent a good part of 1983 
		interviewing thousands of people on what they wanted&nbsp; and didn't 
		want in a video game console.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari Inc. was 
		introduced through
        Warner Communications, to a new firm that was now under contract 
		directly to Warner Communications through their Atari/NY Lab.&nbsp; The 
		company was called General Computer Corporation, a strange new bedfellow 
		in the Warner-Atari relationship who
        earlier had lost a lawsuit with Atari regarding a &quot;Speed-up&quot;
        board that GCC had been selling for Atari's Missile Command arcade 
		machines, turning them into &quot;Super Missile Attack&quot;. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Art Ng, Steve Golson and several of GCC's Chip Architect Designers with assistance
        from VLSI&nbsp; would architect and design the GCC1702B
        &quot;MARIA&quot; Graphics Processor, the heart of the Atari 7800
        ProSystem</font><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; The first 
		MARIA chip was numbered GCC1701.&nbsp; GCC's engineers were big fans of
        Star Trek, so with the Enterprise being NCC-1701, they made their chip
        the GCC-1701.&nbsp;&nbsp; The final production chip: Maria II was
        GCC1702B.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;The all new
        graphics chip called MARIA (Also the codename of the 7800 Project) with
        almost 100 independent sprites, better color palette onscreen, and other
        powerful features would not only allow game designers the ability to
        code new and exciting games, but the chip also allowed an original Atari
        TIA processor to co-exist side by side with MARIA so that the new
        console could also play all of the original Atari 2600 games as well.</font>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Then as an added bonus, GCC's programmers&nbsp; would also do almost
          all of the Atari 2600, 5200</font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">games
          in 1983-1984 for Atari. Atari's programmers in Sunnyvale were
          jumping ship to start their own firms. After another batch left to
          start Imagic, another group threaten to leave Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve Ross, head of Warner Communications contacted GCC about doing
          games for Atari.&nbsp;Not only was GCC able to code games for
          Atari's console, they were doing it in weeks compared to months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Steve

			<font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The
          Atari 7800 ProSystem was the ultimate video game console creation, a

        Atari, Inc. from 1983-1984 The Atari 3600 (as the Atari 7800 was called
        for the first several months</font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">of the
        project) was stated as &quot;Company #1 Priority&quot; and in many Atari

        <font face="Arial,Helvetica">&quot;3600 System takes precedence over

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"> Basically
        Atari was putting everything and everyone
        into the 7800 to make it a winner.&nbsp;&nbsp; To make sure the system
        had every bell and whistle possible, the
        system was slated to be released with not only a computer keyboard, but
        also a High Score cartridge (Designed
        by GCC), and a new add-on module for the Atari 5200 which would have
        given the Atari 5200 system full Atari 7800/2600 compatibility to ensure
        its existing base of 5200 owners
        could immediately take advantage of all the hot new games that the 7800
        was capable of producing (Designed
        by Gary Rubio).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The
        Computer Keyboard add-on plugged into&nbsp; joystick port #2 with an
        accompanying cartridges turned the</font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">7800
        into a full blown 8-bit computer system.&nbsp;&nbsp; The keyboard even
        had an Atari SIO (Serial I/O) connector</font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">for
        using Atari XL Computer System peripherals like cassette recorders,
        printers and even a disk drive.&nbsp; OSS (Optimized Software Systems)
        wrote OSS/Atari 7800 Basic so that users could do Basic programming on
        the 7800 with the Computer add-on.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The one truly key feature was the on-board &quot;Out of th</font><font face="Arial">e 
        Box&quot; Atari VCS 2600 compatibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari also wanted to 
        avoid any chance of another flood of poorly written games for the 
        console, so they had GCC add an encryption key system into its 
        cartridges and console.&nbsp; If the checksum key was valid the MARIA 
        chip would become active and the 7800 was ready
        to go, if not then the system would stay in 2600 compatibility mode.</font></font><font face="Arial">
        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;When Atari was
        sold to the Tramiels in July 1984, the Tramiels primary goal was the 
        design and production of its new &quot;RBP&quot; computer system. (Which would be 
        released as the Atari 520ST)&nbsp;&nbsp; According to product scheduling 
        logs from Tom Brightman, the Tramiels were actually focusing on video 
        games as part of their future.&nbsp;The Atari 2100 (which would 
        become the Atari 2600jr) was on the schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tramiels and Warner Communications were at odds as to who owed GCC 
        payment for all of the work on the &quot;MARIA&quot; chip and the 7800 system.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        After nearly 9 months the Tramiels were the ones who owned the debt to 
        GCC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reluctantly Jack Tramiel paid a one time &quot;Go 
        away&quot; amount to GCC, who cashed that check immediately before it 
        bounced (according to a GCC engineer.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </font>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Now the 
        next issue arose...&nbsp; 7800 games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Tramiels now owned the 7800 console, they didn't own any games for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        More negotiations with GCC would ensue...&nbsp;&nbsp; finally by late 
        1985 a deal was made with GCC for nearly a dozen games for the 7800.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        With 1986 fast approaching, Atari could finally prepare the 7800 for 
        retail sale and it would not be alone, Nintendo and Sega would also have 
        their consoles in the marketplace as well.</font><p>
		<font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">It should be
        noted, that early in the Spring of 1983 Nintendo approached Atari to
        license and sell their Famicom system under the Atari name since
        Nintendo didn't feel it could compete against the once mighty video game
        giant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In August of 1983, Ray Kassar was let go as
        Atari's CEO, in the upper management shuffle, the Nintendo deal slipped
        through the cracks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Becoming
        impatient,&nbsp; Nintendo decided that they would sell their Famicom in
        the U.S. on their own and called it The &quot;Nintendo Entertainment
        System&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NES was test released in 1986.&nbsp;&nbsp;  </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Atari Corp,&nbsp; 
        since the day the Tramiels had bought Atari in July of 1984 had already 
        planned a strong return into the Video game industry.&nbsp; The Atari 
        &quot;2100&quot; project (In development since 1983) which would become the Atari 
        2600jr was being readied for release in early 1986.&nbsp; The Atari 7800 
        after nearly 18 months of legal wrangling between Atari Corp, Warner 
        Communications and GCC along with Atari Corp. paying GCC a $3.2 million 
        settlement for the rights and ownership to the MARIA chip, the Atari 
        7800 was also readied for a 1986 release.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Atari however 
        found itself in a sudden and rapid disadvantaged position...&nbsp;
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Atari Corp. 
        would hit a major brick wall when it came to licensing games.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Nintendo had created far reaching exclusive license agreements with many 
        major and even new software companies, 
        blocking Atari from gaining access to games on their console.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Sega didn't have this problem for its Master System because it had a 
        large library of arcade titles that had never been ported to the home 
        console market, so it faired better.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari was stuck with 
        having a large, but aging library of titles and an unfair position in 
        the market due to Nintendo.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Nintendo had the market;
        lock, stock and barrel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to mention Sega with its
        Master System was also hot in Nintendo's tail, Atari was running third
        in a race it used to run a far lead in first in the past.&nbsp; Atari 
        would sue Nintendo for unfair business practices.&nbsp; Unfortunately a 
        Judge would rules against Atari on the case and Nintendo continued to 
        lock Atari out of gaining access to many hot new titles which would've 
        substantially benefited the Atari 7800 in sales.</font></p>
