1982 at the WCI Atari New York lab by Steve Mayer and Gregg Squires. The nickname "VAL" was for Greggs wife.&nbsp;Five years after the initial Atari 2600 was sold, the only other improvement
to the 2600 line before this was the introduction of a 4 switch cost reduced 
				version and then an all black
version. Apparently Atari under Warner Communications was concerned
about all the competition from other system manufacturers and commissioned
a new ultra low cost 2600 to be designed in 1982 as a replacement to the aging
2600 console.&nbsp;The console was conceived after extensive Human
Factors analysis by a company called Henry Dreyfuss Associates who conducted
various studies on controller design, distance for separation of joysticks,
control, feel and design.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the analysis, the dimensions
of the VAL and the design of the joysticks were finalized.&nbsp; Although the 
				joystick ended up being a hybrid of two of the most chosen 
				designs.</font> <br>&nbsp;

The motherboard itself only occupies two thirds of the case, the remaining
area is taken up by the built in joysticks which rest atop mylar touch-sensitive

					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The earlier Brown WCI/NY Val 
					shown here is actually the very first prototype hand sample.&nbsp; 
					So early the case was hand cast and the internal motherboard 
					doesn't even have a cartridge connector on it and the mylar 
					joystick circuit boards aren't even done in it yet.</font><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;"VAL" project was eventually halted, however
the original idea of a newer low cost 2600 did continue and was brought
to final product as the Atari 2600jr.</font><p align="justify">
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Actually when the 2600jr project was being developed by Atari, Inc under
Warner Communications, the project&nbsp; nicknamed "Bonnie" and at one
point "Janis" was designated the Atari 2100.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
those who have been curious enough to open a 2600jr, you will note that
the system board is (c) 1983.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2600jr was designed by Atari,
Inc under Warner Communications, the 2600jr. was actually competition to
the CX-2000, engineers in Sunnyvale Atari labs didn't like the CX-2000
and the 2600jr. was their response to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2600jr. has the
name "ACTION" on it, that may have been its nickname under the Tramiel
owned Atari.</font>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another side note:&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain Atari Engineering Logbooks show
that the Atari 7800, once completed, would then be introduced as a newer
"Low Cost 7800" and they were considering the use of the Atari 2100 case
(later known as the 2600jr case).&nbsp;&nbsp; This version of Atari 7800
was never designed.</font> <br>&nbsp;
					<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>UPDATE: Oct 7, 2017</b> - While reviewing 
					documents in the Atari Museum archives, a second storage 
					tube of Atari 2000 drawings were found.&nbsp;&nbsp; These 
					drawings appear to show that Sunnyvale Atari was also 
					working on a version of the CX-2000 without joysticks:</font><p align="justify">
