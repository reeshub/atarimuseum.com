<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari Videogame consoles (as opposed to Atari's earlier
standalone single function consoles) got their start in 1977 with the introduction
of Atari's VCS (Video Computer System).&nbsp;&nbsp; The VCS was originally
ready to ship in 1976, however due to a legal clause in an earlier settlement
between Atari and Magnavox over the release of PONG in 1972, Magnavox would
own the rights to anything Atari produced for 1 year, so Atari delayed
the VCS release so that Magnavox would not own the rights to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Atari VCS was originally conceived in Grass Valley, California.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The second iteration was done in Sunnyvale, CA.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari Video
Computer System was initially going to be a new multipurpose console chassis
with a single multi-programmable motherboard which would have its games
installed internally into a rom slot.&nbsp;&nbsp; This design was quickly
dropped in favor of selling the same concept except making the rom slot
external and selling the various games in cartridge form that consumers
would buy and plug into the console.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally only
10 games were to be designed for the console since it was designed to play
games such as Pong, Tank, Outlaw and various other simple challenge games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However designers had unknowingly created a console who's hidden potential
was quickly discovered by programers who created games far outperforming
what the console was original conceived to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then came
Space Invaders for the Atari VCS, the first licensed arcade title.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The VCS took off and noone could stop is popularity and success.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1978 several of the same engineers who had designed
the Atari VCS were already laying out plans for a new set of chips with
so much power and abilities for graphics and sounds that Atari's next game
console would far overshadow its first creation, the VCS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However Atari was now headed by Raymond Kassar who was brought in by Warner
Communications, Atari's parent company when it was sold to WCI in 1976
by Nolan Busnhell for $28 Million.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ray Kassar wanted Atari
to compete against Apple in the home computer market.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new
Super Game console chip set was now turned over to Atari's brand new Home
Computer Division and became the Atari 8 bit chip set.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It would not be until 1982 that Atari's vision of a Super Game console
would become a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, Atari took the 8 bit
chip set and built an all new Super Game System around it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Originally code named PAM, Atari's new Super Game System would almost be
called P.A.M. for Personal Arcade Machine, however Atari settled on its
model number: 5200.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was born, the Atari 5200: Super System.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari's release of the new Super System was ill timed
and poorly supported by research from marketing which was ignored.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The vein of most people's complaints were its amazingly innovative controllers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
While introducing some impressive features, the controllers were difficult
to handle for long periods of time and broke easily and were costly to
repair.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Super System was also faced with serious competition
from Coleco with its impressive Colecovision console and Coleco's barrage
of expansion modules and peripherals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything from Super
controllers to Steering Wheels to even an Atari 2600 VCS compatible interface
for playing all of the games made for the Atari VCS 2600 console.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before Atari even had such a module available for its own Atari 5200 Super
System!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari fired back with a peripheral that even
today stands out as an impressive and well engineered product, the Atari
5200 Trakball.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However that wasn't enough, adding to
this was the fact that Atari packaged with its console Super Breakout,
while Coleco packaged the hottest Coin-Op game at the time: Donkey Kong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then something happened that noone could fight against...&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Great Video Game Crash.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Black Friday on Wall Street,
the crash hit, people saw video games as a fad that had reached its peak
and had passed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Company Exec's panicked, packed up and
ran faster then Pac Man with all four ghosts hot on his trail.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the dust had settled, Atari picked up its pieces
and its badly bruised ego and went to work on making right all that was
wrong with its past consoles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Working with and more importantly
LISTENING to test groups.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari and GCC (General Computer Corporation)
got to work on an all new game console.&nbsp;&nbsp; First fix, it would
be compatible with Atari 2600 games automatically, no modules.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The unit would have encryption so Atari could control what software was
released in its high performance "7800 Mode" so there wouldn't be a repeat
of the huge flood of lousy software titles which caused the Great Video
Game Crash to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; The console would have lots of expandability
and several peripherals would be made available at launch.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Peripherals included a dual joystick holder for games like Robotron 2084,
Battlezone and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp; A high Score Cartridge that could
keep high scores for up to 65 different games.&nbsp;&nbsp; A computer CPU
add-on module and a computer keyboard to turn the system into a beginners
computer system that would be able to use existing Atari Home Computer
Systems peripherals like disk drives and printers (software would not be
compatible with the home computers.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For its bruised
and battered Atari 5200 owners, Atari planned an expansion module called
SLAM-PAM which was an Atari 7800/2600 compatibility module so Atari 5200
owners could use all of the existing 2600 software, plus all of the new
Atari 7800 software.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The console was ready, the first
5,000 units were on their way from the EL Paso, TX manufacturing plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pre-release reviews were ecstatic, the console would certainly be a success...&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then it happened, on July 2, 1984 Atari was sold and the Atari 7800 and
its unannounced low cost brother the Atari 2600jr. were shelved until 1986
when they were finally sold to a gaming public that had nearly forgotten
about Atari and was more interested in the new systems from Nintendo and
Sega.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Although nothing more then an Atari computer with built
in Missle Command and a detached keyboard, Atari released in 1987 the Atari
XE Game System which met with luke warm acceptance, Atari repackaged and
re-released several older tried and true Atari Home Computer System software
titles into cartridge form.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1989 Atari would come
back into the gaming market with a surprise entry which would turn out
to be a amazingly powerful and portable game system.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was
called the Atari Lynx Color Portable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slightly bigger
then a VCR tape, the Lynx was a color handheld game system acquired by
Epyx a gaming software company which decided to get into the console market
but had run out of money to market their product.&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally
called "Handy" Atari acquired the Lynx technology and several software
titles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lynx was overshadowed by the Nintendo Gameboy,
a primitive black and white LCD game and the Sega Nomad which were marketed
far heavier.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari Lynx, far superior to all the other
portable game systems with its slew of add-ons like portable battery pak,
carrying cases, sunvisors, Lynx cables for multi-user game play and its
fairly healthy line of games just couldn't fare as well as the other game
consoles, but continued strong for quite sometime.&nbsp; In fact today
Songbird Productions has been releasing brand new software titles for the
Lynx.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993 Atari made one last push at getting back
into the very market which it had helped to pioneer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Working on the Atari Jaguar, a 64-bit gaming console which was acquired
from Flare II Atari dropped work on its own in-house console called Panther
and the big push was on.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari Jaguar 64 would be built
by IBM, sporting a DSP Digital Signal Processor, and several custom microprocessors
on a 64-Bit wide bus that had expansion to support various types of video,
external modems, networking of consoles for multi-user games, attachment
of a CD-ROM player for enhanced gameplay and even a VR Virtual Reality
headset system for fully immersed gaming experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Jaguar although an admiral console just didn't have the quality of
game worthy of its 64-Bit title.&nbsp;&nbsp; With a few shining stars such
as Tempest 2000 and Alien vs. Predator the oncoming threat of the Nintendo
64 and the Sony Playstation quickly put an end to the Jaguar and to Atari's
consumer electronics division as Atari folded into a reverse merger in
1996 with JTS a now defunct hard disk maker.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jaguar console
was heavily modified and installed into Atari Games Corporation Area 51
arcade video coin-ops and called the Co-Jag.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari Games
Corporation was a separate Atari company that split off from the Atari
consumer division/computer division in 1984.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Atari Jaguar and the Atari Co-Jag were the last of Atari's video gaming
consoles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today Atari Corp is owned by Hasbro and is called
Atari Interactive.&nbsp; They design and sell Atari classic gaming titles
for PC's and other gaming platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari Games Corporation
is owned by Midway/Williams and has now been absorbed into Midway and lost
its own identity and exists no more.
