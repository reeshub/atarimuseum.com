<font size="1" face="Arial">Atari 
Videogame consoles (as opposed to Atari's earlier standalone single function 
consoles) got their start in 1977 with the introduction of Atari's VCS (Video 
Computer System). The VCS was originally ready to ship in 1976, however due to a 
legal clause in an earlier settlement between Atari and Magnavox over the 
release of PONG in 1972, Magnavox would own the rights to anything Atari 
produced for 1 year, so Atari delayed the VCS release so that Magnavox would not 
own the rights to it. </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 4; margin-right: 4" align="justify">
<font size="1" face="Arial">The 
Atari VCS was originally conceived in Grass Valley, California. The second 
iteration was done in Sunnyvale, CA. The Atari Video Computer System was 
initially going to be a new multipurpose console chassis with a single 
multi-programmable motherboard which would have its games installed internally 
into a ROM slot. </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 4; margin-right: 4" align="justify">
<font size="1" face="Arial">This 
design was quickly dropped in favour of selling the same concept except making 
the ROM slot external and selling the various games in cartridge form that 
consumers would buy and plug into the console. Originally only 10 games were to 
be designed for the console since it was designed to play games such as Pong, 
Tank, Outlaw and various other simple challenge games. However designers had 
unknowingly created a console who's hidden potential was quickly discovered by 
programmers who created games far outperforming what the console was original 
conceived to do. Then came Space Invaders for the Atari VCS, the first licensed 
arcade title. The VCS took off and no one could stop is popularity and success.
<br>
<br>
In 1978 several of the same engineers who had designed the Atari VCS were 
already laying out plans for a new set of chips with so much power and abilities 
for graphics and sounds that Atari's next game console would far overshadow its 
first creation, the VCS. However Atari was now headed by Raymond Kassar who was 
brought in by Warner Communications, Atari's parent company when it was sold to 
WCI in 1976 by Nolan Bushnell for $28 Million. Ray Kassar wanted Atari to 
compete against Apple in the home computer market. </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 4; margin-right: 4" align="justify">
<font size="1" face="Arial">The 
new Super Game console chip set was now turned over to Atari's brand new Home 
Computer Division and became the Atari 8 bit chip set. It would not be until 
1982 that Atari's vision of a Super Game console would become a reality. 
Basically, Atari took the 8 bit chip set and built an all new Super Game System 
around it. Originally code named PAM, Atari's new Super Game System would almost 
be called P.A.M. for Personal Arcade Machine, however Atari settled on its model 
number: 5200. So it was born, the Atari 5200: Super System. <br>
<br>
Atari's release of the new Super System was ill timed and poorly supported by 
research from marketing which was ignored. The vein of most people's complaints 
were its amazingly innovative controllers. While introducing some impressive 
features, the controllers were difficult to handle for long periods of time and 
broke easily and were costly to repair. The Super System was also faced with 
serious competition from Coleco with its impressive ColecoVision console and 
Coleco's barrage of expansion modules and peripherals. Everything from Super 
controllers to Steering Wheels to even an Atari 2600 VCS compatible interface 
for playing all of the games made for the Atari VCS 2600 console. Before Atari 
even had such a module available for its own Atari 5200 Super System! Atari 
fired back with a peripheral that even today stands out as an impressive and 
well engineered product, the Atari 5200 Trackball. However that wasn't enough, 
adding to this was the fact that Atari packaged with its console Super Breakout, 
while Coleco packaged the hottest Coin-Op game at the time: Donkey Kong. Then 
something happened that no one could fight against... The Great Video Game 
Crash. Like Black Friday on Wall Street, the crash hit, people saw video games 
as a fad that had reached its peak and had passed. Company Exec's panicked, 
packed up and ran faster then Pac Man with all four ghosts hot on his trail. <br>
<br>
After the dust had settled, Atari picked up its pieces and its badly bruised ego 
and went to work on making right all that was wrong with its past consoles. 
Working with and more importantly LISTENING to test groups. Atari and GCC 
(General Computer Corporation) got to work on an all new game console. First 
fix, it would be compatible with Atari 2600 games automatically, no modules. The 
unit would have encryption so Atari could control what software was released in 
its high performance &quot;7800 Mode&quot; so there wouldn't be a repeat of the huge flood 
of lousy software titles which caused the Great Video Game Crash to happen.
</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 4; margin-right: 4" align="justify">
<font size="1" face="Arial">The 
console would have lots of expandability and several peripherals would be made 
available at launch. Peripherals included a dual joystick holder for games like 
Robotron 2084, Battlezone and so forth. A high Score Cartridge that could keep 
high scores for up to 65 different games. A computer CPU add-on module and a 
computer keyboard to turn the system into a beginners computer system that would 
be able to use existing Atari Home Computer Systems peripherals like disk drives 
and printers (software would not be compatible with the home computers.) For its 
bruised and battered Atari 5200 owners, Atari planned an expansion module called 
SLAM-PAM which was an Atari 7800/2600 compatibility module so Atari 5200 owners 
could use all of the existing 2600 software, plus all of the new Atari 7800 
software. </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 4; margin-right: 4" align="justify">
<font size="1" face="Arial">The 
console was ready, the first 5,000 units were on their way from the EL Paso, TX 
manufacturing plant. Pre-release reviews were ecstatic, the console would 
certainly be a success... Then it happened, on July 2, 1984 Atari was sold and 
the Atari 7800 and its unannounced low cost brother the Atari 2600jr. were 
shelved until 1986 when they were finally sold to a gaming public that had 
nearly forgotten about Atari and was more interested in the new systems from 
Nintendo and Sega. <br>
<br>
Although nothing more then an Atari computer with built in Missile Command and a 
detached keyboard, Atari released in 1987 the Atari XE Game System which met 
with luke-warm acceptance, Atari repackaged and re-released several older tried 
and true Atari Home Computer System software titles into cartridge form. In 1989 
Atari would come back into the gaming market with a surprise entry which would 
turn out to be a amazingly powerful and portable game system. It was called the 
Atari Lynx Color Portable. Slightly bigger then a VCR tape, the Lynx was a color 
handheld game system acquired by Epyx a gaming software company which decided to 
get into the console market but had run out of money to market their product. 
Originally called &quot;Handy&quot; Atari acquired the Lynx technology and several 
software titles. The Lynx was overshadowed by the Nintendo Gameboy, a primitive 
black and white LCD game and the Sega Nomad which were marketed far heavier.
</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 4; margin-right: 4" align="justify">
<font size="1" face="Arial">The 
Atari Lynx, far superior to all the other portable game systems with its slew of 
add-ons like portable battery pack, carrying cases, sun visors, Lynx cables for 
multi-user game play and its fairly healthy line of games just couldn't fare as 
well as the other game consoles, but continued strong for quite sometime. In 
fact today Songbird Productions has been releasing brand new software titles for 
the Lynx. <br>
<br>
In 1993 Atari made one last push at getting back into the very market which it 
had helped to pioneer. Working on the Atari Jaguar, a 64-bit gaming console 
which was acquired from Flare II Atari dropped work on its own in-house console 
called Panther and the big push was on. The Atari Jaguar 64 would be built by 
IBM, sporting a DSP Digital Signal Processor, and several custom microprocessors 
on a 64-Bit wide bus that had expansion to support various types of video, 
external modems, networking of consoles for multi-user games, attachment of a 
CD-ROM player for enhanced gameplay and even a VR Virtual Reality headset system 
for fully immersed gaming experiences. The Jaguar although an admiral console 
just didn't have the quality of game worthy of its 64-Bit title. </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 4; margin-right: 4" align="justify">
<font size="1" face="Arial">With a 
few shining stars such as Tempest 2000 and Alien vs. Predator the oncoming 
threat of the Nintendo 64 and the Sony Playstation quickly put an end to the 
Jaguar and to Atari's consumer electronics division as Atari folded into a 
reverse merger in 1996 with JTS a now defunct hard disk maker. The Jaguar 
console was heavily modified and installed into Atari Games Corporation Area 51 
arcade video coin-ops and called the Co-Jag. Atari Games Corporation was a 
separate Atari company that split off from the Atari consumer division/computer 
division in 1984. </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 4; margin-right: 4" align="justify">
<font size="1" face="Arial">The 
Atari Jaguar and the Atari Co-Jag were the last of Atari's video gaming 
consoles. Today Atari Corp is owned by Hasbro and is called Atari Interactive. 
They design and sell Atari classic gaming titles for PC's and other gaming 
platforms. Atari Games Corporation is owned by Midway/Williams and has now been 
absorbed into Midway and lost its own identity and exists no more. <br>
