Atari 
Corp finally returned to the home video game console market with its advancement 
64 bit multimedia entertainment system called the Atari Jaguar 64.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
system featured high resolution graphics, superb stereo sound and DSP expansion 
capabilities which made it the perfect platform for a whole new generation of 
video games and accessories.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Atari Corp's short lived
re-entry back into the market would not last long, with Sega's Saturn and Sony's
Playstation consoles looming on the horizon and Jaguar 64 sales not meeting
expectations the plug was 
pulled on both the Jaguar 64 and Atari Corp itself in 1996 when Atari allowed 
itself to be reverse merged with JTS Corp, a&nbsp; hard disk manufacture startup 
from the famous Dr. Jugi Tandon. The company was 
hungry for a fresh injection of fast cash and an easy route to becoming a 
company with publicly traded stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; ATC ceased to exist on the stock exchange 
and JTS took its place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately manufacturing defect 
rates were too high and Compaq cancelled a do or die contract with JTS and the stock then proceeded to nose dive from $3-4 per 
share to .65 cents per share (one time as low as .12 cents) and had held around 
that number until the company went bankrupt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
JTS management then liquidated the remaining stock of Jaguar 64's and related 
products and ceased support to the Jaguar 64 line.&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to&nbsp; the shadow of an SEC investigation for not 
maintaining Atari's business as specified in the reverse merger agreement, JTS 
quickly sold the Atari division.</font> </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
On March 3, 1998 JTS sold its Atari division to Hasbro Interactive for $5 
million and Hasbro began to sell retro-game versions of Atari's most popular 
titles for the PC and Playstation markets.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hasbro only pursued
software releases of Atari titles and no plans of utilizing any of Atari proprietary hardware designs for any new 
console or handheld games ever came about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hasbro Interactive
was purchased among other US companies by Infogrames, a well known European game 
company.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the US companies were pulled together an became 
Atari, Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2004 Atari would make its first return into the 
console market with the Flashback-1 console, other consoles are on the horizon 
including Flashback 2.0, a 100% 2600 VCS compatible game console. </font></font>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Today's 
Atari is owned by a small group of 5 French Investors who have been licensing 
the Atari name and have taken $3million of crowdfunding to attempt to put out a 
linux box in a modern piece of plastic called the Atari VCS.</font></td>
