&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FFFFFF"> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">In
1995 rumors began to circulate that Atari was working on a replacement
for the Atari Jaguar console.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Codenamed "Midsummer"
this new Jaguar would have a new Tom II and Jerry II chipset with better
graphics, sound, more expansion and a built-in CDROM (There was also a system called JagDuo
circulating in rumor circles but confusion existed as to whether the JagDuo
was just a regular Jaguar with built-in CDROM or if in fact it was the
Jag II with built-in CDROM.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom II is so large and generated
so much heat, it required its own cooling fan which has to be hooked up
to a seperate power source.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After tinkering with
the unit for a few days and fixing a few broken wires, I finally fired
it up with Tempest 2k, the console works, but I find no improvements in
the graphics, sound or game play, so unlocking and unleashing the enhanced
features that may be present in the Jaguar II are unknown.... but it is
backward compatible.</font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Interestingly enough, this unit is codenamed
"COBWEB"</font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img SRC="jag2-expansion.jpg" width="600" height="400">
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another interest aspect is the Jaguar
II's expansion connectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jaguar sported</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">both and A/V connector and a DSP Connector.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Jag II does one better with a third</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">expansion connector for some unkown future
expansion devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also if you look at</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the motherboard, you'll notice a 2nd unpopulated
bank of memory for the Jaguar II.</font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Keeping with the
whole theme of the codename of the console: "Midsummer"</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">as in William Shakespears
"Midsummers night dream"&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Tom &amp; Jerry II</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">chipset was also
given codenames reflecting the characters from</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the well known play:&nbsp;
Oberon &amp; Puck</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(a label underneath
this unit says Oberon &amp;Theseus.)</font>
</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Unfortunately, just
as the play's own message says "Love is blind" so was</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the fact that Atari
was blindly travelling down a short and windy road headed</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">for its painful
demise as 1996 approached and with it the end of the Jaguar,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the hopeful Jaguar
II and Atari itself as the company would be reverse</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">merged into JTS
Corp, a small hard drive maker who quickly squandered</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Atari's money and
liquidated the warehouse of Atari Lynx &amp; Jaguar stock,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">then filed for bankruptcy
in 1998.</font>
