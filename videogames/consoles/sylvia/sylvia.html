<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>According
to engineering logs, in 1980 through 1981 Atari began work on a new video game console
to replace the&nbsp; Atari 2600 Video Computer System.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
new console during development took on many codenames: Sylvia, Super-Stella
and also... PAM (with notes next to it saying "Super-Stella: Multipurpose".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Popular myth stated that the new console was to be based on a new 10-bit processor and would have
more memory, higher resolution graphics and improved sound while maintaining
compatibility with all existing Atari 2600 console games.</font></font>

<font size=+1 face="Arial,Helvetica">Popular myth states that Prototypes
were built and a one or two preliminary games were written for the new
"super" console.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However before the design could be finalized
on the new console, the feedback from the programmers was that the console
was too difficult to program on and they didn't want to do games on it
since it was so difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this has never been 
fully verified.</font><p>&nbsp;<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In January 2010, the Atari Museum discovered the actual schematics to Sylvia 
(Model #SS1000) aka &quot;Super-Stella&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which, according to an 
interview with Steve Bristow, would have a new TIA chip called the STIA (or 
Super TIA) with enhanced graphics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also added to the design 
was a version of the ANTIC chip called the FRANTIC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Included memory would've been 2k, which would've been a huge jump from the Atari 
2600's original 128 bytes of memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another interesting 
addition to the design was a Voltrax SC01 Voice Synthesizer.</font><p>&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1">Meanwhile, time was running short for 
Atari, Intellivision
was breathing down Atari's neck so to speak and rumor had it that other
companies were developing new game consoles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2600 with
its aging technology was in danger, a new console was needed and quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before project Sylvia even got a name (The console was named ATARI SYSTEM
X) the project was cancelled and replaced with a quick solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Repackaging the Atari home computer technology into a game playing console
codenamed PAM, Atari almost named the second "SYSTEM X" PAM which would
have stood for P.ersonal A.rcade M.achine, however Atari 5200 was chosen.</font>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>During
the development of the new Atari 3200: System X, Atari was also preparing
a clone version of it to be sold through its Sears distribution channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This console was to be called the Sears Super Arcade II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Actual prototypes do exist of the case designs, the above pictures were
donated by Roy Nishi, former head of Atari's Industrial Design group.</font></font>
