<p><font size=+1 face="Arial" color="#000000">Marketing for Atari said that
Bigger is better so the 5200 was HUGE to say the least, but it was cool.&nbsp;
It had this big bad ominous look to it that said "I'm the Most Powerful
Video Game System Around".&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, to be quite frank, the 5200
was too big.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure it had storage for its controllers, but it
was just too big and more importantly, too expensive (think of the shipping
on those things alone!).&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari commissioned its engineers to
design a smaller, more low cost version of the 5200 dubbed the 5100 (nicknamed
the 5200jr. or Little PAM)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit functioned exactly
as the 2 port 5200, however it was a smaller system board and lacked the
expansion port.</font>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><font size=+1>The
System looked more or less like a smaller version of the Atari 5200.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The case design was done by Mark Biassotti who also did the Atari 2600jr
case design.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit is a functional equivalent
of the Atari 5200 2 Port system.&nbsp;&nbsp; It uses the same Power supply
and also uses a standard TV Switchbox instead of the Atari 5200 4 port
version automated switch box/power box.&nbsp;&nbsp; The main difference is the
lack of a storage area for the 2 5200 Controllers.</font>

        interesting to note; the Atari 2700 console (unreleased) also had a
        storage compartment for its 2 remote controllers and they were very
        close in size to the 5200 controllers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atari 2700
        console is nearly the same size as the 5100 though...</font><p>&nbsp;</td>
