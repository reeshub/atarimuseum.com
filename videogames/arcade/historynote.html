This is where it all began.&nbsp;&nbsp; Syzygy, oopps...&nbsp; I mean Atari
started in the wonderful world of Coin-Op/Arcade entertainment in 1972.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Their first product under the Atari name was called PONG.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
simple, yet addictive game sparked what is now a 7 billion dollar industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some will argue that the arcade division was the only true part of Atari
even though the consumer division with the Atari 2600 took the spotlight
most of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1972 there were no video games, only pinball
machines, fortune tellers, ball toss and other obscure forms of Coin-Op
amusement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once PONG hit the scene there was no stopping the
tidal wave force of those magical cabinets with the glowing screens and
the musical beeps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari in a sense
has come full circle in its 25+ years of existence.&nbsp;&nbsp; It all
started with arcade games, then came the home consumer games, then the
computers, then it went back to just arcade games at Atari once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No matter what the future brings, all of us have been touched in one way
or another by the phenomenon called....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</font></b><font size=+1>January 14, 2000:&nbsp;&nbsp; On a truly sad
note, it has been made official, Atari Games Corp. which is a subsidiary
of Midway Games after it was purchase by Midway/Williams in 1996 has announced
that it will no longer manufacture arcade games under the Atari Games Corp
name anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; San Francisco Rush 2049 is the last
Atari Games Corp game.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All future games coming from 675
Sycamore Drive in Milpitas, California will now be under the name Midway
Games West.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a truly sad day to see the very name
which launched the Video Arcade Industry no longer used on coin-op games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Midway is doing an injustice to itself and the industry by discontinuing
the use of the Atari Games name and logo.</font></font>
