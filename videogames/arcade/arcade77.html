Destroyer was a unique 1 player experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; With a combination
of realistic controls, sound effects and the use of 3D cardboard graphics
overlaying the monitor the game gave the player a feel of playing a realistic
sea battle game.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With sonar and explosion sounds from
the left and right speakers the game had a fully immersed experience....
for 1977.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit could have variable
time settings or set on demonstration mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also offered
"Durastress" reliability and "Instapart" 24-hour parts turnaround to keep
the unit up and running.</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Produced and sold under Atari's
secretly owned competitor KEE Games, Super Bug gave racing fans a new twist
on playing an overhead view racing game.&nbsp;&nbsp; Designed by Howard
Delman Super Bug had both Novice and Expert tracks and also had random
track layouts to keep racers on their toes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another nice feature
was multi-language text support.</font></font>

project (Super Bug was his first),&nbsp;&nbsp; Canyon Bomber was quickly
converted for the VCS.&nbsp;&nbsp; He describes it as "upside-down Breakout"
and says it was a far superior two-player competitive game than when played
one person versus the computer.&nbsp; He modified the Sprint 2's circuitry,
then programmed it.</font></font>

Dennis Koble effort, Avalanche is a great example of a game that everybody
has played but probably doesn't know.&nbsp; There's no question that Activision's
Kaboom (by Larry Kaplan, another Atari alumnis) was a rendition of Avalanche.&nbsp;
And while we're on the subject, Drag Race, which came out 10 months earlier,
has since become Dragster, another Activision Title.</font></font>

was without a doubt the best of the bunch.&nbsp; You had sweeps and keepers
and down-and-outs and a video gridiron that seemed like it could go on
forever.&nbsp; For a quarter you got a minute-and-a-half, but fanatics
were known to pop in 10 bucks worth and go the full hour.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
best Atari game since Super Breakout, which came out the month before.</font>

Lander is an interesting story for a lot of reasons.&nbsp; It was game
that had been around forever on PDP and IBM computers (only in text).&nbsp;
It was Atari's first game that utilized an XY hardware system (vector graphics).&nbsp;&nbsp;
It had already sold 5,000 units when Atari killed it to make room for Asteroids
on the assembly line.&nbsp;&nbsp; Collectors, take note:&nbsp; Delman says
that there are 200 Asteroids that went out in Lunar Lander cabinets, same
art and all.</font>

winner.&nbsp;&nbsp; With fluorescent "disco" 3-D playfield, challenging
targets, bumpers, slingshots, rollovers and drop targets Atari Video Pinball
had it all, but without all the mechanical objects associated with classic
pinball games.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything was produced on the video screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even a pinball "nudge" feature is included to give a more realistic feel
to the play action.</font></font>

SUBS was the first two-monitor video game from Atari.&nbsp; The intriguing
submarine battle puts each player in control of a search and destroy mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Using a realistic sonar locating image, accurate steering and firing controls,
the players must act quickly to score hits.&nbsp;&nbsp; The unique cabinet
design allows each of the two players to use their own TV monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition to the dual monitor, this was the first game with an operator
optional add-a-coin or regular credit coinage mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; In add-a-coin
mode, the game can be set on eight different times per coin.</font></font>
