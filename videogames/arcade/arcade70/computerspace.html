      <p><font size="+1" color="#000000" face="Arial">Computer Space started on
      the day Nolan came into the office at AMPEX where he was employed, having
      moved into Ted Dabney's office that he was now sharing with
      Nolan.&nbsp;&nbsp; On this day Nolan asked Ted how vertical and horizontal
      worked on a TV. Ted explained how it worked and then Nolan asked Ted an
      interesting question, could he put a spot, a tiny dot on a TV screen and a
      circuit to move that spot up and down as well as left and
      right...&nbsp;&nbsp; Ted said sure, it could be done and he went home at
      the end of the day to start setting up a workshop in his home where he
      would design this new technology called the Spot Motion Circuit.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" color="#000000" face="Arial">As work progressed, in the
      evenings Ted would work on this design and Nolan would come over to his
      home to see how things were progressing.&nbsp; Meanwhile a curious pair of
      watchful eye's peaked in from time to time wanting to see what was going
      on.&nbsp; Ted's daughter Terri would be witness to her dad's creation of
      this technology using all sorts of little objects and using little black
      items like looked like insects...&nbsp; IC chips.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Finally the circuit was ready, a spot was now displaying on the screen and
      with a horizon and vertical sync controller, the dot could be moved around
      the screen, the spot now had motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nolan saw this and his
      eyes lit up and his creative juices became to flow... excited, he now saw
      the potential for a whole new future - video games!&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike
      Nolan's previous idea of taking an expensive mini-computer and running a
      Spacewar! game on it, this new circuit could be the foundation for a very
      inexpensive dedicated system to play a Spacewar! type game on a TV set,
      Nolan now started to describe to Ted what he wanted him to do next...</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" color="#000000" face="Arial">Ted would move his
      daughter out of her bedroom and turn her room into his new workshop to
      expand and build a full blown video game from this circuit that so far,
      had done nothing more than put a little dot on the screen and could move
      it around.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" color="#000000" face="Arial">As Ted finished circuits
      and designs for this new game, Nolan would take his notes, make schematics
      and then went and enlisted a junior engineer at Ampex by the name of Steve
      Bristow to do the PC Board layout design of the boards needed to make
      these circuits into something producable.</font></p>
