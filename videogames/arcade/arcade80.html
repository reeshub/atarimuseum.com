putting a new twist on the video racing game.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the player
navigates a winding track that they can only see a small window of the
size of the screen instead of a whole overhead view as before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vivid colors, realistic sound effects and even driver ratings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
8 Tracks to choose from, extended play, find fuel for extra time, plus
the operator could set various levels and languages as well.</font></font>

was the first coin-op to offer an almost fully immersed first person vector
graphic gaming world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, so realistic was
this game that is got the attention of the US Army who hired Atari to redesign
the game using simulated controls from a Bradley Fighting Vehicle and modified
the software with tragectory and other more real world combat settings
for training purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed Rotberg, a v.p. of engineering at
Videa, programmed both versions (arcade and army).&nbsp;&nbsp; He preferred
working on the original.&nbsp; "Battlezone", says Rotberg, "was the first
truly first-person game."&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet another first for Atari.</font></b>

go back to November 6, 1979 when Asteroids, Atari's best selling coin-op
game of all time (70,000 units), was released.&nbsp;&nbsp; The story goes
that Asteroids was once a game called Cosmos.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, Cosmos
was once known as Planet Grab, in which you had to claim a planet by touching
it.&nbsp; Anyway, Ed Logg programmed Asteroids, Delman did the circuitry,
and Lyle Rains nursed the idea until rocks began swimming around in his
head.&nbsp; Asteriods Deluxe goes one better with newer features and harder
challenges.</font></b>

second bestselling coin-op game (50,000 units), Centipede is basically
Space Invaders with a Trak Ball.&nbsp; One of the few female engineers
in the business, Donna Bailey programmed it.&nbsp; "My main focus is graphics,"
she says.&nbsp; "For instance, I really like pastels, which is why there
are so many pinks and greens and violets in Centipede.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really
think the visuals should be arresting."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Centipede
was a truly unique and colorful game, not only attracting the attention
regular gamers, but also appealing to female players as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Centipede has been re-released by Atari Interactive for the PC, Playstation
and the new Sega Dreamcast.</font></b>

the success with its XY games Atari decided it was time to go techni-color.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tempest was the first example of that.&nbsp; With its 96 levels and skill-step
innovation (you could start the game at a higher level if you wished),
Tempest carried the state-of-the-art banner until Zaxxon came along.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was designed by Dave Theurer of Missile Command renown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tempest is also been converted many times.&nbsp;&nbsp; An unreleased version
of it for the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 consoles was made.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atari Corp released it as Tempest 2000 for the Atari Jaguar 64, Atari Interactive
released it for the PC platform.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was released as Tempest
X for the Sony Playstation and a fully emulated version was included with
the recently released Atari Arcade Hits #1 by the all new Atari Interactive
owned by Hasbro.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tempest is one of the most sought after
coin-op games to own.</font></b>
