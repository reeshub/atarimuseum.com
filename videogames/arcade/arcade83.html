first attempt into the new and exciting world of interactive laserdisc
technology, Firefox was based on the movie by the same title starring Clint
Eastwood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the storyline of the movie, you have
stolen the secret Soviet fighter and must bring it back safely to the United
States.</font>

<font size=+2>Crystal Castles introduced us all to Bentley Bear, the cute
little character who has to recover stones within a haunted castle.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is a fun and challenging game, lots of pleasant colors and landscapes
made this a game that appealed to almost everyone for fun, cuteness and
a challenge.</font>

<br><img SRC="tx-1.jpg" height=262 width=200 align=LEFT><font size=+2>Three
Screens, no waiting (except on the long lines to play this game when it
first came out).&nbsp;&nbsp; TX-1 was Atari's entry into fully emersed
surround action.&nbsp;&nbsp; With 3 seperate screens making up an almost
270 degree view, players were fully out racing in an almost life-like environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
TX-1 was a truly enjoyable game.</font>

<font size=+2>Remember when video games were fun and challenging and you
didn't need to do a 25 step combo joystick-fire button sequence to get
your character to do something?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well Paperboy was just such
a game, lots of fun, challenge and laughs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It stars your
average kid next door trying to earn a buck while being chased by dogs,
avoiding cars and doing some dirt biking on the side.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
was the true spirit of Atari Games... fun!</font>

<br><img SRC="rotj.JPG" height=262 width=200 align=LEFT><font size=+2>Return
of the Jedi.&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the third part of the Star Wars Triligy,
Atari brought to arcades every mover goers dream, to actually be a part
of the Star Wars saga.&nbsp;&nbsp; ROTJ takes you through multiple senarios
and challenges from Speedbiking through the Endor forest to piloting the
Millenium Falcon through the structural interior of the newly built second
Death Star.</font>

<br><img SRC="packrat.JPG" height=262 width=200 align=RIGHT></div>
<font size=+2>Peter Pak Rat is yet another enjoyable game which stays within
Nolan's unwritten rule of video games "Make it easy to learn, and hard
to master".&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter Pack Rat gives you a simple premise, find
and pack away as much jumk as possible and earn as many points as possible
before his enemies get him.</font>
