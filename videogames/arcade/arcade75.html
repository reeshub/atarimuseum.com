<br><a href="/videogames/arcade/fullsize/breakout.jpg"><img SRC="BREAKOUT.JPG" align=LEFT width="290" height="218"></a><font size=+1>The
ultimate in Pong, Breakout was designed by "this non-degreed engineer,
but sharp kid from Palo Alto, "explains Steve Bristow, "named Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
"(Do you know him?&nbsp; He's only the iCEO of Apple Computer.) Jobs had
an unusual working arrangement with Atari at the time.&nbsp; Bushnell would
describe a game and specify a certain number of integrated circuits (ICs)
he wanted jobs to use.&nbsp; For every IC he saved he received a $1OO bonus.&nbsp;
Jobs turned out a very compact prototype of what turned into Breakout.&nbsp;
"I think he brought it down from 80 to 30 ICs, " says Bristow.&nbsp; "It
wasn't common but that's how that one happened. "&nbsp;&nbsp; In truth
it was Job's friend Steve Wozniak who designed Breakout, not Jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
However jobs received a $5,000 bonus and told Wozniak it was only $700
and gave Steve Wozniak his "50%" ...&nbsp; $350.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years
later this truth would come out and it would add to the already increasing
friction between the two which eventually lead to Steve Wozniak quitting
Apple.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile at Atari, the Breakout design was ingenious,
however no one could figure it out so production could not begin, so it
had to be redesigned all over again by someone else.</font>
