Race.... from the originators of Pong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Space Race, Atari's
second coin-op video game was a high tech outer space version of a drag
strip.&nbsp;&nbsp; You raced as one player against the clock or two players
could go head to head racing through space, avoiding meteors and asteroids
to get the best time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari's new sales flyers were now
in vivid color and with attractive models as well.</font>
<br>(History Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The owners/operators manuals in the Space Race cabinets were actually Atari
Pong manuals and have the name PONG scribbled out and Space Race hand written
over the top of the scribbled out Pong name)

<font color="#000000" face="Arial"><font size=+1>Rebound from Atari.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Taking the concept of Pong to an entirely new "angle" so to speak.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rebound was Atari's video game version of Volleyball.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The game required two players to compete head to head in this game and
with enough practice, players could learn to angle the ball and beat their
opponent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although a black &amp; white game, it came
in a rather uniquely designed cabinet with colorful graphics on the sides.</font>

The controller on this game was a joystick with a domed top to it, well actuall

enough...&nbsp;&nbsp; they look like a pair of

Pong came Quadrapong.&nbsp; What's interesting is that this was essentially
the same game as Elimination, which was created by Kee Games, Joe Keenan's
company.&nbsp; Bushnell and Keenan decided that the best way to reach the
most distributors was to design and manufacture similar games but under
different names. The first experiment of this sort was Rebound (Atari)
and Spike (Kee).&nbsp; The key distinction between the two was a "spike"
button Spike had.&nbsp; According to Steve Bristow, the designer, "If you
timed it right you could do a real killer spike.&nbsp; "</font></div>

The last batch of Pong games came next: Pin-Pong, which was video pinball,
and the inimitable Doctor Pong (<a href="/videogames/arcade/puppy-pong.html">aka,
Puppy Pong</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's right, folks.&nbsp; Someone
at Atari had the bright idea to put Pong in a cabinet shaped like <a href="/videogames/arcade/fullsize/snoopy-pong.jpg">Snoopy's
doghouse</a>.&nbsp; Steve Bristow explains.- "The idea was to put it in
a doctor's waiting room and set it on freeplay. We put it out, but doctors
didn't want to pay for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand Schulz wasn't crazy
about it either.&nbsp; "</font>

was the next true milestone in Atari's history.&nbsp; Who invented it,
however, is a matter of opinion.&nbsp; Some credit Lyle Rains, who was
the engineering v.p. in coin-op until only recently in 1982, but Steve
Bristow says it was he who came up with the concept.&nbsp; (For you VCS
fans, Tank is Combat CX-2601.)&nbsp; "I was working on it when I hired
Lyle," he recalls, "Then I gave it to him and he finished it.&nbsp; A lot
of the implementation was his, but the original idea was mine."&nbsp; Both
agree that Tank carried Atari through 1975.</font></font></p>

was always catching flak from the Pinball industry that video games would
never surpass Pinball games in sales or game play.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari's
answer to them: PinPong, a pinball version of Pong.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on
Atari would introduce a newer version of Pin-Pong known as Video Pinball
into the arcades, Video Pinball entered the home market as a stand alone
console and also as a cartridge for the Atari 2600 VCS.</font>

would "veer" away from missed shots.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a duck was shot it
would fall into the marsh to be retrieved by your on-screen digital
dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coin-op incorporated a unique alarm system that if the gun was stolen
or tampered with the game would emit a loud buzzing sound.</font>
