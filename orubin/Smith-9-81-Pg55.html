            and it's a feedback system, and the player is in the loop of the
            feedback, and while he's giving the feedback to the game, we hope
            he's getting some kind of enjoyment out of it.&quot;
            <p>Which is how it all began, in the mind of Nolan Bushnell. A big,
              vigorous man with playful eyes who keeps a painted wooden clown
              and mounted papier-mâché zebra head in his office at his new robot-and-fast-food
              enterprise, Pizza Time Theatre, Bushnell is the man who figured
              out how to get the rest of us to love the computer, and who started
              Atari to do it.</p>
            <p>He first got the idea of video arcade games as an undergraduate
              at the University of Utah, where he played Spacewar games on the
              engineering lab computers at night, and supported himself by working
              at an amusement park in the summertime. It was while trying to
              convince strollers to toss baseballs at milk bottles to win stuffed
              animals they didn't really want, he recalls, that he realized what
              an attraction the engineering lab computer games would be on a
              midway. &quot;But when you divide 25 cents into an eight-million-dollar
              computer, there ain't no way,&quot; he says, &quot;so I sort of
              filed that concept in the back of my mind.&quot;</p>
            <p>In only a few years, however, the price of mini-computers came
              down so far that Bushnell, with a bit of electronics ingenuity,
              almost had the hardware for an arcade game worked out, using one
              minicomputer hooked to several TV terminals. The minicomputer was
              not quite powerful enough, so Bushnell added more computer circuits
              to the terminals to keep track of specific things, and he kept
              making the terminals' hardware smarter. Then he had a 25-cent idea. &quot;I
              said, 'Hey, maybe I can do it all in hardware, and have a </td>
          <td width="50%" valign="top">stand-alone terminal. And the minute that
            happened I worked it out/and the economics were overwhelming. That
            was really how the first video game started.&quot;
            <p>That 25-cent idea changed the history of the computer, but no
              one knew it at the time. The legend is that Bushnell built the
              first game. Pong, in his garage. Actually, he moved his daughter
              out of her bedroom to build it, and it wasn't Pong. The first was
              a game called Computer Space, a flying saucer and rocket ship dogfight
              with turn, thrust and fire buttons, in a fiber glass cabinet. &quot;The
              rocket ship followed Newton's third law&#151;action and reaction&#151;to
              ten percent accuracy,&quot; Bushnell says. Only 2,000 were made,
              but it was enough of a success to encourage Bushnell to build his
              next game. Pong, which became so popular and so widely distributed
              that almost everyone could get his hands on the hardware.</p>
            <p>The games were marketed through the traditional distributors of
              pinball machines and still are, except that they now make up about
              80 percent of the business in many places. Many distributors at
              first showed no interest, and most thought the games would make
              a brief splash, then disappear from the market. The distributors
              still don't know quite what happened, or why. Despite an initial
              appearance in places where pinball was played, which led many people
              to see these games simply as a new sort of electronic pinball,
              the computer games are as different from pinball as the iron horse
              was from the horse. Pinball is essentially a game in which the
              player matches mechanical skills with a machine. It is the natural
              plaything of the industrial revolution, in -which machines created
              a mechanical advantage over human labor. The computer games are
              the first playthings of an information rev-</td>
