      The third flyer above is from a Canadian ad about Quadrascan, which is
      Atari's color vector technology, and Space Duel. And yes, that's me sitting
      at the keyboard. I kept asking to be in an advertisement, and they hated
      my moustache, so I finally got into an ad out of focus in the background
      :)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Space Duel Objects</b><br>
      <br>
      I was asked about what caused the small flying saucer objects to appear,
      and how other object in Space Duel were programmed, and if the rocks actually
      aim at the player. Here is how it worked:<br>
      <br>
      (I will call the spinning items in Space Duel "rocks" for this discussion.)
      In Space Duel, there were several reasons to launch a saucer. If you let
      too much time pass without hitting anything, a random number would launch
      either one or two small saucers or the juggler ships (the two saucers that
      tossed shots back and forth and increased their distance as they wrapped
      the screen).<br>
      <br>
      Also, if an amount of time when only a few rocks remained was hit, they
      were launched as well. From three to one rock, with fewer rocks making
      the possibility go up. In addition, longer game play times increased the
      likelihood of a saucer as well. ALSO, they would be sent out at random
      after a timer expired in each wave, with the timer getting smaller with
      each sucessive wave. There may have been other reasons, I cannot recall.<br>
      <br>
      The saucers actually calculated a shot which would hit either the player
      or a rock, with a 50/50 choice early on, and more on the player as time
      passed. There was a randomness added to the aiming (plus or minus some
      offset in degrees) which became more and more accurate with total game
      time. If you sat still, you would eventually get hit. Shot leading, or
      calculating where an object WOULD be when the shot was fired was also added
      in, and also became more accurate with time. Thus, long game times would
      cause shots to be deadly to not only a ship standing still, but one moving
      in a straight line as well. No lurking at the edges in Space Duel as you
      could in Asteroids.<br>
      <br>
      The small blue + items that were launched DID curve to find you, also getting
      faster and more accurate with time. The number (from 1 to 7) also went
      up with total game time. You might note that you can shoot them, they change
      color, and eventually SEEM to disappear. In reality, they are simply tossed
      to the edge, and become a bit more "angry", meaning they were more accurate.
      So, if you kept shooting them, they quickly became more annoying.<br>
      <br>
      There were also Stars and fuzzballs. They were launched during the bonus
      wave usually. The stars are "thrown" at one of the two ships, but do not
      course correct. When they leave the screen, they warp around as fuzz balls.
      These do track. Again, the longer the game time, the more they tracked
      and faster they went. These objects are also tossed out when only 1 rock
      is left.<br>
      <br>
      Lastly, the rocks. There was little smarts in the rocks. The only real
      smarts was to NOT bring back a ship in the path of a moving rock. And just
      in case it happened because it moved too fast, the ships are protected
      for a period of time for "free" as they reenter (they flash!) A rock splits
      on random vectors. Even the previous direction is mostly ignored, although
      the rocks split off in a 270 degree split (approx. angle) THEY DO NOT TRACK
      THE USER! I know people swear that I aimed the rocks and changed their
      paths. Didn't need to. The only "hidden" attribute is that IF too many
      objects are on the screen when a rock is hit, it will "POP" and disappear
      and not split.<br>
      <br>
      The game itself made it onto The Who's 1981 "It's Hard" album. Pretty cool,
      I think :) Click the pictures below to view the album jacket.<br>
