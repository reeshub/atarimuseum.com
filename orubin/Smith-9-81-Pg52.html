        in the lab.</td>

      <p>Arcade video games have made Atari a major new player in the entertainment
        empire known as Warner Communications. A 1980 market research survey
        by Atari showed that 86 percent of the U.S. population between the ages
        of 13 and 20 has played some arcade video games, and estimated that Americans
        are spending $2.5 billion a year on them. They have spread so rapidly
        that they have taken the culture by surprise Not even the players seem
        to know quite what to make of them, or why they are so appealing. Kids
        whose attention span approaches zero in schools spend long hours at apparently
        repetitive tasks on these machines, improving their skills. The players
        frequently describe themselves as addicts and junkies. MIT sociologist
        Sherry Turkic reports that some business executives she has interviewed
        in the game arcades compare the experience of playing these games to
        transcendental meditation.</p>
      <p>Inside the engineering labs and offices at Atari there is a similar
        air of excitement and inspiration. Everyone here seems to feel that computers
        are going to play a much friendlier role in our lives than most people
        ever expected. The image of the large, centralized computers that make
        impersonal organizations even more impersonal, that insist on their own
        billing errors and whose superior mentalities seem best suited to writing
        junk mail, are not the kinds of computers Atarians have in mind. And
        their perceptions seem to be based on their own experiences. &quot;People
        aren't going to be able to be scared of computers very much longer,&quot; one
        young games programmer assures me.</p>
      <p>Dave takes me a short distance down a corridor lined with numbered lab
        doors. Behind them are the video games of the future, in various stages
        of development from a few blips and squiggles on video monitors hooked
        up to rows of printed circuit boards, to advanced mock-ups in cardboard
        skins, with display panels that blaze into action when anyone hits the
        start button. Most of the time, someone has. Dave pulls his chair up
        to a video tube next to a computer, types in a few instructions and begins
        to play his new game, intently twisting a control knob and hitting the
        fire button, avoiding electric bolts and zapping monsters, no longer
        talking to me and unaware of the pack of other programmers and engineers
        gathering at his back to wait a turn at the game. Some of them haven't
        had breakfast yet.</p>
      <p>They are doing what other people are putting millions of coins a day
        into video-game machines to do in arcades around the world. &quot;I have
