    <td width="50%" valign="top">of my trance it would be eleven at night, and
      I'd say, one more game, and when I snapped out again, it was two in the
      morning, and I knew I was in trouble. If I counted what it would have cost
      me in quarters, I would have spent several thousand dollars playing Asteroids.&quot;
      <p>A strange thing is going on here. These people are being changed by
        the computers they work with. They love the machines, bugs and all. It's
        not just the games, nor the engineering personality's desire for logic
        and order that makes these computers so stimulating: it's their size.
        They've got small enough to become individuals. These programmers are
        no longer working with systems. They are working with friends. They are
        on such intimate terms that they swear at them, hit them, even laugh
        with them. What is strangest, though, is that they seem to bear no resemblance
        to those human cyborgs science-fiction writers warned we would become
        once the computers got hold of us. Instead, these people seem to be having
        a hell of a time.</p>
      <p>Trying to explain, Dona talks about her microprocessor with a romantic
        passion that men don't always inspire. &quot;In the Valley, almost everybody
        has something to do with computers, and some people think I'm just frittering
        my life away here,&quot; she says without a blush. &quot;A lot of them
        work on IBM 370s and that kind of thing, and they can't fathom what it
        is to have the whole little thing to yourself!&quot;</p>
      <i>
      <p>&quot;The computer is a pal that doesn't get mad&quot;</p>
      </i>
      <p>What's really going on here? Before coming to Atari I had asked Isaac
        Asimov, a pioneer in science fiction, why he thought these games were
        so attractive. &quot;Kids like the computer because it plays back,&quot; he
        said. &quot;You can play with it, but it is completely under your control,
        it's a pal, a friend, but it doesn't get mad, it doesn't say 1 won't
        play,' and it doesn't break the rules. What kid wouldn't want that?&quot; That
        sense of being in control seems to be something Atari programmers enjoy
        as much as the players. Indeed, there are cognitive psychologists like
        James McConnell at the University of Michigan who think our most basic
        drive is an urge to get the environment under control.</p>
      <p>McConnell describes behavior in terms of feedback terminology: &quot;The
        nice thing about using computers is that you can establish control over
        your inputs, which allows you then to control your outputs.&quot; In
        other words, if you control the challenge or reward, you can improve
        your performance. McConnell's language is remarkably similar to what
        one of Atari's electronics engineers said to me, as he was explaining
        how a game works: &quot;Essentially we have a microprocessor and input-output
        devices. All these games are, is process control. You take some kinds
        of inputs</td>
