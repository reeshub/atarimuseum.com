      Another minor update. Added a message from Owen about emails that all must
      read before contacting Owen with your questions and concerns. Please take
      the time to read and understand the message. Thanks.<br>
      <br>
      A HUGE update coming soon, with a couple of surprises. Stay tuned :)<br>

      Added a flyer of Owen "hard at work" on Space Duel. The flyer is entitled "Visioneering.
      The Quadrascan Color System and New Space Duel." You can view the flyer <a href="vision.jpg" target="mainFrame">here</a> and
      from the <a href="spaceduel.html" target="mainFrame">Space Duel</a> page.
      Thanks to our good friend Scott Evans from <a href="http://www.safestuff.com" target="_blank">Safestuff.com</a> for

      Just a minor update. Added some new Mailbag stuff, fixed some broken links,
      and added screenshots to the Grudge Match page now that the game is in
      MAME. Also added a new counter.<br>

      Removed the About page and linked the resume in PDF format. Also added
      some new Mailbag & Stories stuff received over the weekend.<br>

      Could it be? YES! It's an update!!<br>
      <br>
      New stuff added to the site includes some new Game Stories for Skydiver,
      PT Commander, Yahtzee, Goalie Ghost, Name That Tune, Shrike Avenger, Grudge
      Match, and Major Havoc. There are a few new Mailbag And Stories submissions,
      and the Mailbag And Stories sections have been rearranged so that the newer
      stories will come first (in Mailbag And Stories page 1). Enjoy!<br>

      Just a quick note- if there is a relatively minor site update (such as
      a mailbag entry), the front page will always have the date of the latest
      update. Unless there's a major update or something newsworthy, there will
      no longer be any mention of it on this page. If there IS, however, a major
      update, we'll let you know on the front page.<br>

      Once in a while, something happens :)<br>
      <br>
      Updated the mailbag pages with new mail. Add 1/2 a page to Mailbag 5, and
      a new full Mailbag page 6. We're hoping to add more information to the
      Game Stories page soon, so keep checking back.<br>

      Finally, a page update! As you can see, there's been a slight redesign
      on the site. It turns out that the site looked like crap in every browser
      other than Internet Explorer on the PC (and IE 4.5 on the Mac, but who
      still uses that old browser?). Therefore, frames were added to get rid
      of the more redundant parts of the pages and to make it compatable with
      every browser. However, it hasn't been tested with every browser. If it
      still looks bad to you, drop me a line and I'll see what I can do to fix
      it.<br>
      <br>
      All dead KLOV links on the Game Stories pages have been fixed.<br>
      <br>
      Derek Litton went to this years California Extreme show and took some pictures
      of a panel that Owen sat on. This panel discussed Atari's past, game design,
      and showed the hilarious "Outstanding In Our Field" video. You can view
      pictures from the show <a href="http://arcade.thelittons.net/2002Extreme/" target="mainFrame">here</a>.
      Owen is the guy staring at the camera, looking pissed off (although he
      really wasn't) :)<br>

      Welcome to the new site design! I think you will find that this new look
      and feel will be much easier on the eyes and the fingers as you navigate
      through it. All of the sections have been expanded (take a look at the
      Game Stories pages to see what I mean) and the clutter has been blasted
      out to hyperspace!! We are quite proud of the work and the finished product!
      Let us know what you think of this new design and feel free to offer any
      suggestions! Meanwhile, enjoy your stay!! (Have I used enough exclamation
      marks?)!!!!!<br>

      I've added a story and pictures about Kermit, a robot that Atari Engineering
      designed and built, and that I rescued when it was abandoned. You can view
      the story and pictures <a

      Well I am quite a keen Atari collector in the United Kingdom, and to say
      getting my hands on anything cool and Atari is hard is an understatement.
      Most of the stuff is as you know in the US. I was just wondering if you
      have any Atari stuff for sale? Like game design pictures, proto boards
      that you might be willing to part with or anything else that is above you
      run of the mill.<br>
      <br>
      I quite appreciate you may have been asked this question 500,000 times
      but you never know huh!"<br>

      Mailbag Updated<br>
      <br>
      I've added new comments and questions to the Mailbag section of the site,
      including a nice story about my game Triple Hunt (Witch Hunt, in particular).

      We Have Moved!<br>
      <br>
      Yes, the site has been moved to the Atari Historical Society's servers.
      Most of you probably never noticed the change. Thanks to Curt Vendel for
      the space and for making us a part of his great collection of pages. Also,
      please take note of the email change. I can now be reached at owen@orubin.com.<br>

      Radio Show Quote Added<br>
      <br>
      The Source ran a radio show in early 1982 about the movie Tron and video
      games, and I was asked to quote about what makes a good arcade video game
      great. You can hear the portion of the show where I made my comment here
      or click the link in the menu at the left. If you wish to hear the entire
      show, visit Tronfan.com and click the Tron Radio Special-1982 graphics

      Dedicated Major Havoc For Sale<br>

      Dan Mowczan has a fully-restored, dedicated Major Havoc machine for sale.
      Dan has painstakingly restored this machine to its original condition,
      and I have offered to post it here in hopes of helping him find this beautiful
      game a new owner. You can see pictures of the game and a description of
      it here.<br>

      Alpha One Prototype Pictures Added<br>

      The Major Havoc prototype Alpha One has been added to MAME. I've put up
      a page with 10 pictures of the game game running. Check out the differences
      in the story compared to Major Havoc! I've explained other differences
      on the page. Check it out here!<br>

      The Who It's Hard Page Added<br>
      <br>
      Happy Holiday's everyone! I've been extremely swamped with work and the
      holidays, so I haven't been able to update the site as much lately. I've
      added a couple more letters to the Mailbag page, and I've also added a
      page for The Who's album It's Hard, which featured one of my games on the
      cover. Click the picture of the cover at the left to check it out. Once
      work eases up a bit, I promise more stories and updates will be forthcoming!
      Happy New Year!!<br>

      Visitor Mail Section Added<br>
      <br>
      I have added a visitor mail section to the site. You can check it out here.<br>
      <br>
      I appreciate all of the kind comments and am pleased to answer your questions.
      I can't guarantee that every message will be added to the page, as a lot
      of times people will ask similar questions, but I will add those that don't
      address something that I have already answered.<br>
      <br>
      You can send questions/comments/etc to owen@orubin.com. Keep them coming!<br>

      The story of Cannonball posted:<br>
      <br>
      We have a new request- the story of my very first game, Cannonball. Created
      in 1976 where I was one of the first programmers to join Atari. I had no
      idea on Atari's game creation process, so I made it up. Ok, not the right
      way, but the game did ship! Have a look, click here.<br>
