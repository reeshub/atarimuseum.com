      <p><font face="Times New Roman">people start coming from other villages
          to join you. Simulations like this first appeared on the university
          computers of the Sixties, along with games like Spacewar. Now kids
          are playing them at home.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even more imaginative and powerful kinds
          of simulations are becoming available. A physicist who is working with
          Atari developing holography for a home game&#151;combining the laser
          optics of holograms, those three-dimensional images of pure light,
          with the smart electronics of the computer chip&#151;mentions an idea
          he thought was pure fantasy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I think you could teach special relativity
          with video games,&quot; he told me. &quot;You can build any set of
          physical laws into that universe, and you can alter the parameters
          so that they are more apparent than they are in normal life; so on
          the screen you make the speed of light be ten miles an hour, put in
          some gravity, make it a game, and kids will start learning special
          relativity, the same way they learn to calculate parabolas without
          knowing what a parabola is, or what calculating is, in order to catch
          a baseball. Now that is really going to open up new vistas. It's hard
          to imagine. Right now people are so full of misconceptions that in
          designing something like a cyclotron it can be tricky to find people
          who have enough feel for relativity to design a machine that will work.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">I didn't know it then, but that game already
          exists. In the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT, Seymour Papert
          developed an orbital game of just this sort where the player controls
          an object on a screen that obeys the laws of physics in space. The
          results were dramatic. &quot;We worked with all sorts of people</font></td>
