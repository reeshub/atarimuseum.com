<font color="FFFF00" size="+1"><strong>Tube Chase started very early as a vector game. I got the idea from the
opening of the original Alien movie during the landing sequence. However, we
could not do hidden line removal, and all those lines got very confusing. It
went through several version of raster hardware from cool ellipses that
could split, to the cheaper square hardware that we finally used, all called
Tube Chase. It was killed and brought back at least 3 or 4 times at Atari
under the same name. It became Vertigo when Exidy first took it, but they
decided to pass on it when it did not test well at the arcades any more (at
that time, it was only 3rd for 10 weeks!), and then finally Tunnel Hunt at
Centuri.<br><br>For information about Tunnel Hunt, check out my article <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/publications/newsletter/v32n2/contributions/rubin.html">Memories Of A Vector World</a> for Siggraph, and <a href="http://rgvac.978/org/~atari/orinterview.html">my interview with Brian Deuel</a> on Brian's Classic Coinop Page.</font></strong>
