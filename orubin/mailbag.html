      From Francis Mariani:<br>
      <br>
      Francis: Hi Owen!<br>
      <br>
      Owen I hope I’m not bothering you with this email, but I’m happy to be
      writing to you, and from me to you: THANK YOU for all of the creativity
      and hard work that you put into the games that you’ve created and/or worked
      on! I’m the proud owner of Major Havoc #00003. I did a lot of restoration
      to it this summer and it’s the gem of my collection. I feel pretty lucky
      to own it. Please know that you’ll always be a welcome guest in my game
      room if you’re ever in Los Angeles.<br>
      <br>
      I’m writing to you because I’m working on a website for my small collection
      of games and I wanted to link your website. I didn’t think you would mind
      but I wanted to make sure anyway.<br>
      <br>
      Here’s the link to home page:<br>
      http://www.ataricade.com.<br>
      At the bottom of the Odds & Ends page is where your site is linked. I’ve
      included the story of the Battlezone volcano there too. :) Please let me
      know if there’s any problem with any of this ok? And I hope you and your
      family are all in good health and that everything’s going well for you. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Great collection and great site. By all means link to my site,
      and I will get a link back to yours as well on my site as soon as possible.<br>
      <br>
      You have some great games. I always loved Food Fight, and I use to have
      Quantum but had to get rid of it when I moved. Believe it or not, I gave
      it away as the monitor was dead. Little did I know 20 year ago what it
      would be worth. SIGH!<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, thanks for the message. Good luck with your collection. By the
      way, excellent job on the restores. I may call you when I am ready to or
      need to fix mine. I have a prototype which has a graphics free panel. Would
      love to get a real panel, so if you find one....<br>
      <br>
      No bother at all, and I wish I could help you. But I am sorry, I do not
      know where one is. Unfortunately, when I got married almost 20 years ago,
      I GAVE mine away. SIGH! My wife needed some room in the house! :-) It was
      in perfect shape, as was the Cannonball prototype I had as well. I really
      enjoyed making that game. It was simple, but with some cool advanced features
      (like the SKYDIVER light up feature.) Glad you enjoyed it. I will do my
      best to be at the Extreme this year (just added it to my calendar.) Happy
      to speak if asked, I like doing that.. I missed it last year, and I was
      sorry to have missed it. If they do an old farts panel again, I am happy
      to join it as well. Cheers, and good luck finding it. If you do, please
      send me some pictures. Would love to see them.</b><br>
      <br>
      Francis: Owen thanks so much! And I really appreciate you linking to my
      site that’s so great of you. I love Food Fight too, and darn you gave away
      your Quantum?! I wish I had known you back then I would have fixed your
      monitor and would have convinced you to keep it forever. :) And I know…I
      wish we ALL knew 20 years ago what we know now. We would all be pretty
      well off!<br>
      <br>
      Thank you so much for the compliments. And please always feel free to call
      I would be more than happy to help if I can. The best number day or night
      for me is my cell (310) xxx-xxxx.<br>
      <br>
      A small run of silk-screened Major Havoc control panel overlays were reproduced
      from the actual film by Phoenix Arcade. That is where I got mine. Here’s
      the link: http://www.phoenixarcade.com/art.htm. They also did a run of
      the side art. Classic Arcade Graphix also has reproduction control panel
      overlays, both dedicated and conversion, but they are not of good quality
      (inkjet) and their link is here: http://www.classicarcadegrafix.com/sunshop/index.php/action/item/id/280/prevaction/search/previd//prevstart/0/.
      As you can see, there’s quite a price difference…but in this instance,
      you definitely get what you pay for.<br>
      <br>
      If you also want the actual control panel too let me know and I’ll definitely
      keep an eye out. I did see one on eBay 3 months ago and I was going to
      buy it just to have in case I ran across a stripped Major Havoc cabinet,
      but I didn’t…probably because the odds of finding a stripped Major Havoc
      cabinet are slim to none. :) <br>

      From Jim:<br>
      <br>
      Q: Hi Owen, I hope you're doing well.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I am doing well, thanks.</b><br>
      <br>
      Just wanted to say a quick hello from Chicago, and thanks for your works
      with Atari. Major Havoc & Space Duel were my most favorite games- both
      are definitely on my top 10 of all time and favorite Atari games- hands
      down. I do give it both a whirl now and again with mame and my logitech
      cordless trackman trackball... Space Duel does ok- but its just not the
      same with MH- level 14 is hard enough (never got out alive) but 15 still
      has me stumped with those cannons- upright version or emulated... ouch!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: To be honest, the last 4 waves were created by Mark Cerny, and
      I too have never made it out of 15 alive. It is very difficult indeed,
      and I have seen Mark do it, but I suck at 15! :-)</b><br>
      <br>
      I've got some questions about the MH conversions- I'm wondering about the
      possibility of a FAQ section on such items in the future- seeing that the
      original MH is very hard to come by.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Ok, lets start one here.</b><br>
      <br>
      Regarding the conversions- I've never seen one or played one in person-
      only the original cabaret type cabinet. Something about that knob vs the
      roller... and twisting the wrist. Its very difficult to find the original
      MH- if anything it will probably be a conversion I'd consider one day...
      I am considering a tempest cabinet down the road, but want to play both,
      wondering if wiring is similar between the two boardsets. Or of some type
      of pcb work can be done where both romsets can be switched between? If
      not a Grivatar would do, something about that Space Duel style cab... one
      of the best!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: There is a major issue with conversion that you need to know.
      The vector generator on MH was faster than on the other, older vector games
      that you convert. That leads to some serious flickering when played on
      a conversion, especially in later waves when many vectors are drawn. So
      a conversion plays slower than on the original. It is not a large change,
      but it is there, and I for one, did not like the way it played.</b><br>
      <br>
      I was not aware space duel was available in cocktail! How many were made?
      And this finding has lead to another idea regarding above+ tempest cocktail!
      The MH boardset doesn't support cocktail mode according to MAME anyway...
      these would make for some neat modifications regardless, and possible cabinet
      builds.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I have one of the Space Duel cocktail cabinets, but how many were
      made, I do not know. But it is large, and VERY heavy, and takes up more
      space than a regular upright. And remember, that people need to be able
      to sit on both sides. I have often thought of trading mine for an upright
      at times because it needs less space and can hug a wall. And no, Major
      Havoc will not work in a cocktail. For one thing, the controls are on the
      side and the monitor is in landscape mode on Space Duel. But remember,
      MH has the monitor turned the long way, which means you would have to play
      from the side. Sorry, but it would require some serious mods.</b><br>
      <br>
      I have limited space where I'm living... and the cocktail has a certain
      appeal. My first acquisition is a Stargate cocktail table (no disrespect
      - went with the hometown Williams/Midway folks and much to my surprise-
      it was available. :) I'd love to see photos of the Space Duel cocktail...
      very nice!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I can send a shot or two. They are attached. I took them with
      my cell phone, so not great resolution, but enough to give you a good idea.
      That is a 1 foot ruler in one shot on the top to give you an idea of its
      size.<br>
      <br>
      As to owning other games, never a problem with me, I have a lot of respect
      for a great deal of other games, and Stargate IS one of them. And since
      I worked for Bally, even less of an issue! ;-) )</b><br>
      <br>
      In any event, thanks again for your time and creativity- I've enjoyed your
      games since I was a youngster. Feel free to write or post any of this if
      you wish.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Thanks Jim, feel free to ask some specific questions as well.
      Will do what I can. <br>

      From Scott Stilphen from <a href="http://www.digitpress.com" target="_blank">Digital
      Press</a>:<br>
      <br>
      Q: Hey Owen,<br>
      <br>
      I just read the new interview with you at Way of the Rodent. I saw where
      you mentioned working with Rob Fulop at Interactive Productions (which
      later became PF. Magic). Were you involved with the (unreleased) Hasbro
      project, "NEMO"? From my interview with Rob Fulop (years ago - http://www.digitpress.com/library/interviews/interview_rob_fulop.html),
      I.P. initially worked on 3(?) games for it (with Nolan Bushnell's company,
      Axlon) - Tech Force, Sewer Shark, and Scene of the Crime (which later became
      Night Trap). Tech Force was never released, but the latter 2 were later
      released for the Sega CD and 3DO.<br>
      <br>
      Did you do any work with their CD-I games as well - Third Degree and Max
      Magic?<br>
      <br>
      Regarding your game, Cannon Ball, do you know who programmed the home version
      for the Atari VCS (Human Cannonball)?<br>
      <br>
      http://www.digitpress.com/dpsightz/atari2600/humancannonball.gif<br>
      <br>
      How did you get the perfect screenshots for your site? I'm using MAME32
      (v 0.96) and it still doesn't emulate this properly (see attached screenshot).
      I don't know if newer versions do, or if a better ROMset has been archived.<br>
      <br>
      Lastly, regarding unreleased Atari laserdisc coin-op games, I happen to
      have a Malibu Grand Prix laserdisc (which I recently transferred to DVD
      - I can send you a copy if you'd like) and noticed a lot of 'extra' footage
      on it (I'm attaching a zip file of some screenshots. Unfortunately I don't
      recognize most of the people who appear...). I'm guessing this was a test
      footage disc, and not the final version since the game was never completed.
      You mentioned (in another interview) working with Ed Logg on the software
      for this, possibly to include graphics (score counters, etc), to be displayed
      on top of the footage? Were you involved in putting together the laserdisc
      as well? Also, I'd *love* to archive your test discs for Golf and Battlestar
      Galactica.</font>
      <div align="right"></div>
      <font color="#ffffff"><br>
      <br>
      Owen: Yes, I was there for Nemo, and did some editing on Night Trap
      (Scene of the Crime), but only a small amount, mostly on editing, and consulted
      on the MTV title which I do not see you mentioning, but I believe Ed Norton’s
      Sewer Race, later called Sewer Shark was already done. I do not recall
      Tech Force. Did you know that NEMO stood for Never Ever Mention Outside?<br>
      <br>
      I do not know who did the home version of Cannon Ball, sorry. Been way
      too long.<br>
      <br>
      As for the screen shot, an early version of the port did not have this
      problem. The Mame version now suffers from a bad graphics ROM, which should
      be easy to fix. But I think my screen shot came from an early photo I had
      of the game, but I do not recall. Feel free to use it if you like.<br>
      <br>
	  </font>
      <font color="#ff0000">NOTE FROM BRIAN: Actually, the romset used in the
      screenshot has a reconstructed graphics PROM that the MAME driver programmer
      worked on. I got ahold of it while I was still a member of MAMEDEV, and
      I think it is now widely available from the usual places.</font><br>
	  <font color="#FFFFFF">
      <br>
      Great pics and yes, I would love a copy, and I will pay postage and costs.
      Looking through the pics, I recognize a few people:<br>
      <br>
      DVD-19 is Paul Mancuso. He was a tech for me and others at Atari. DVD-23
      is John Ray. I will have to take some time to recall the others. But what
      a fun look back!<br>
      <br>
      The Malibu I worked on with Ed Logg was a vector generator game. I believe
      I left before this disc game was started.<br>
      <br>
      As for my test discs, I guess I could copy the footage, but I am reluctant
      to send them anywhere. How could we make it happen?</b><br>
      <br>
      Scott: Thanks for the info. I never knew NEMO was an acronym! (I just realized
      that Wikipedia mentions that). I've heard that the early digitized video
      ran on a modified Colecovision(!). A few years ago I talked with former
      Imagic artist Michael Becker, who did some work for it (and also referred
      to it as the "Isix" VHS Interactive Movie video system. He mentioned it
      had several different names. Wikipedia also refers to it as "Control-Vision".)
      and described it as such:<br>
      <br>
"By the way, I believe Michael Becker was [one of] our artists at Interactive
Productions if I recall correctly.<br>
      <br>
      The Isix was a VCR-like box that attached to your VHS player. Think of
      a second VHS unit with a board filled with RAM that sat on top of the VHS
      and cabled into it with a controller port. You inserted a videotape with
      interleaved video (4 tracks) and 16 interleaved tracks of audio (or still
      images). It worked a lot like railroad switching; if you pressed a controller
      button at an edit point it could jump to another track (never backward!).
      It was this technology that we originally designed Sewer Shark and Night
      Trap for. That was essentially what they envisioned. I thought it interesting
      they only ever stress tested-the interactive video with ONE Panasonic player
      and that after about 100 playings the data began to rub off the tapes." This
      is correct. Basically, all games had to be in real time as the input was
      a VHS tape playing real time. In a nutshell, the system had frames encodes
      with a “video channel number.” The box would hold a frame until that channel
      numbered frame came by again. So, for example, you could have two frames
      1 2 1 2 1 2 going by, and switch the channel in real time. That gave you
      two channels to do interactive. Or you could do 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 2 5 1 2 6
      1 2 3 ... Which is what Night Trap did. So, if you tuned to channel 3,
      it would only change occasionally, basically, an empty room. We had the “snow” screen
      effect to mask the channel while changing if you had to wait for the channel
      to come around. Then sounds were added by the system to make the channel
      seem active. Unfortunately, when you wanted to play again, you had to replay
      the tape. As mentioned, tapes start to ware out after 75 or less plays,
      and the first thing to go was the vertical blank signal which contained
      the encoding for the “channel number.”"<br>
      <br>
      What was the MTV title you mentioned? Never heard of that one.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: They got the MTV VJ Martha Quinn to record some video. You were
      given the job of creating a music video. On the screen we could show ALL
      channels at the time time as small pictures, and this would have 4 or 5
      channels and a bunch of special effects. You would press buttons to select
      the video channels and effects. At the end we would replay the video, and
      Martha would rate your video at the end. Either she got fired, or she gave
      a virtual kiss, or something in between. I am not sure who did the whole
      title, but I recall working with some people on ideas.</b><br>
      <br>
      Scott: Rob Fulop also mentioned the original version of Night Trap done
      for Hasbro featured a hidden scene with a topless Dana Plato, but he didn't
      know if it was added into the Digital Pictures version that came out on
      the Sega and PC. I asked Michael about this but he didn't know about it.
      Do you remember anything about that trick?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Not exactly topless. In the original game, a few of the major
      game points where you HAD to trap a few monsters to win took place at the
      same time Dana was in the bathroom getting ready for bed. In that scene,
      she took off her top and stood looking at herself in the mirror, where
      the camera was “hidden”, wearing only a bra (you could not see below her
      waist.). The idea was that typical young guy would stop and watch that
      camera hoping she would go further, but I never recall her going completely
      topless. If there was a topless version, I did not know about it But it
      was THIS scene that got Night Trap into such trouble and caused the start
      of the video game rating issues with Congress.</b><br>
      <br>
      Scott: Speaking of Easter eggs (I created and maintain the EE section at
      Digital Press: http://www.digitpress.com/eastereggs/), I was digging through
      your email section and saw a letter from Stephan Jokisch about finding
      your initials in Orbit! Did either you or him ever figure out which key
      presses trigger them to appear on the screen? I looked through the MAME
      roms I have, and the only interesting thing I found was this small graphic
      that shows what appears to be the letters "OIL" (picture attached) in rom
      labeled "033711.a7". <br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: That is funny. The OIL is a left over graphic from SPRINT, which
      is probably what hardware I think we used. I suspect that this was just
      never removed. I believe what he speaks of was never released, but I do
      not recall exactly what we did. I think I simply wrote it out in program,
      so it would not be in the ROM directly as initials. There was a table in
      the game code that had initials, but do not ask me where. They would be
      as ASCII bytes most likely.</b><br>
      <br>
      Scott: I used a program called Romhack to look at the graphics, but I had
      to use a digital camera to get a screenshot (picture attached) since there's
      no option to save one directly. Are these the initials in question? (though
      IIRC you've used "ORR" on the high score tables in several other games).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: That is not them.</b><br>
      <br>
      Scott: This was a real surprise to me, because up until now, Warren Robinett
      has always been credited with being the first person to put an Easter egg
      in a game (he created a secret room in his 1980 VCS Adventure game that
      displays his name). A few people have mentioned that a 1978 Channel F game,
      Video Whizball, was first, but in speaking with the programmer, he mentioned
      he got the idea from hearing about programmers at Atari doing it. I know
      Rick Maurer came to Atari from Fairchild around that time, so I figured
      that's possibly how the Channel F guys hear about them. Where did you get
      the idea to put on in Orbit?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: We wanted to put names in games for a long time, and as a long
      time Hacker, it was obvious. I did several. In an EARLY release of Orbit,
      entering a special code at the right time in attract would give you free
      time on the game. I though I could play it when in an Arcade for free.
      I when the field test location one day, and even though they would have
      given me free tokens, I decided to enter my very long code. I looked around,
      no one was watching, and bang, I had free time. A week later, I went back
      to see a bunch of kids hanging around the game, and watched one kid, about
      14, enter the code and start playing. I walked up to him and asked him
      how he knew how to do that, and he just shrugged. My guess, he saw me do
      it, or did it by pure accident and had a good memory for what he pressed.
      It was removed from the game obviously.<br>
      <br>
      There were a few Easter Eggs in a game I did called Sebring. This was a
      racing game based on the mechanical game called F1. It was beautiful, and
      sadly never released because of the cost, but imagine a first person driving
      game LONG before any others. Well, you drove only on a circle track and
      always turning left, passing cars as they approached when you could. There
      were billboards along the road with phony advertisements, but when you
      went fast, I would change one billboard to have my name and the name of
      the hardware engineer go by. It went by fast, and unless you knew where
      to hit the breaks to make it stop, you would never see it. Or so I thought.
      Now remember, names in games, a bad thing at the time. Well, Gene Lipkin,
      our VP of Sales, was playing the game, and all of a sudden I hear him yell
      out, “Owen, did I just see your name go by?” I played dumb. He then slams
      on the breaks and RIGHT in front of his face is a bill board with my name
      and the electrical engineer’s name on it, VERY large, in the center of
      the screen. Needless to say, he was not amused. Sebring was a late 70’s
      game I believe. This game also only used two ROM chips for the game on
      the board, and if you put them in the wrong sockets on the board and turned
      it on, the machine makes an explosion sound, and the screen says, “The
      ROMS are in backwards, dummy.’ But if you hit the self test switch, it
      still runs correctly, but says ROMS: KO instead of the usual message ROMS:
      OK. Mike Albaugh and I worked long and hard on creating this position independent
      self-test which HAD to work correctly. No other game ever did this.<br>
      <br>
      In Major Havoc, at one time you could jump through the corner of a wall
      in a maze (a bug, not a feature) but on one of the mazes, if you did this
      you would fall for a long time through nonsense and then see our names
      in vectors. I think this too was released from the later version. If you
      can still jump though the wall and touch the clock you see in a few mazes,
      all the objects in the maze slow WAY down for a period of time. It was
      going to be a game play, but it made the waves too long, so we moved the
      clock outside the maze. But I believe the code is still in there. There
      is also a large robot like from Disney’s The Black Hole (Max) and we never
      got to use that. It would have been used in the game final on the planet
      which we never created.<br>
      <br>
      I am sure there are others, it will come to me.</b><br>

      Scott: Did you have Easter eggs in any of your other games? And do you
      know of any other coin-op games that had them during that time?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: As for others, no, I do not know.</b><br>
      <br>
      Scott: Cannonball/Human Cannonball - Ah well. This is the only early (70s)
      VCS title that I don't have a name for (one of my other "jobs" at DP is
      maintaining the VCS section of the database. Btw, I can't thank you enough
      for saving the original Stella proto...). I don't know if you'd recognize
      the programmer's name if you saw it, but I attached a current listing of
      all the released VCS titles, along with the programmer(s) for each. If
      not, no problem.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: OK, looking at the list. It might have been Bob Polaro, but I
      am not sure. Sorry.</b><br>
      <br>
      Scott: Malibu Grand Prix - Thanks for identifying some of the Atari coin-op
      people from the laserdisc. I wish there was more lab footage like that
      :) There's actually very little of it (time-wise) on the disc I have, and
      I had to step through it frame-by-frame to capture most of them. It's possible
      a few others still slipped by me. Some of it is obviously there as an in-joke.
      The pic of the girl (#8) appears in the beginning and says something like "this
      is the future" and then it cuts to flashing images of money (#9) and someone
      dialing a (meaningful?) sequence of numbers on a keypad (#11). Near the
      end some footage of Pole Position appears, so I guess this is what the
      laserdisc game was trying to emulate(?). The whole video is actually sandwiched
      between the beginning and ending of an Atari commercial (one of those that
      featured Jack Palance's narration).<br>
      <br>
      From some of the comments of yours in regards to Malibu (in your article
      for SigGraph), it sounded like you might have been working on a different
      Malibu, but I wasn't sure. So there was a vector version, which you and
      Ed Logg were working on (and predates the laserdisc one), correct?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Correct. It was based on Battlezone hardware and was a true first
      person driver. You could drive anywhere. The problem is, you could drive
      anywhere, so if you left the track, all those lines and things became very
      confusing. It was WAY before the Laser Disc. Funny thing, I was sent to
      graduate classes at MIT by Atari to study laser disc technology, and then
      only worked on a few pieces of the games. Battlestar Galactica, Golf Trainer,
      and Knight Rider, none of which went very far. Probably Golf went further
      than others for me, and then I left Atari.</b><br>
      <br>
      Scott: You mentioned on your site about a tape someone sent you from another
      test disc that featured video for the game, Playland, which also included
      footage meant for a racing course game that sounds very similar to MGP.
      You stated:<br>
      <br>
"We wanted to do a real driving game, and I recall someone on the same team I
was on doing this at Sears Point in California near Napa. Doug Phol kind of did
what he wanted. Even though I was supposed to be in charge of VD games, he took
a team out and started shooting all this stuff (I mean crap!) without talking
to anyone. Can you imagine trying to make a game out of that footage? I do not
know what they were thinking. I do remember him getting laid off finally."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Yea, he liked the idea, and just did what he wanted for sure.
      He spent a LOT of money on video, and it was all crap. I have a funny feeling
      so was the Malibu footage for what it really needed to be.<br>
      <br>
      The real sad part of this was when I came back from MIT, I said, “DO NOT
      DO VIDEO DISC GAMES. BAD IDEA.” No one listened, and they let others do
      the games after that.<br>
      <br>
      Playland was VERY cool footage, and was going to use, if I recall, the
      Laser Disc much like the disc in Cube Quest, mainly as backgrounds. I wish
      I knew what happened to that tape, it was amazing stuff. If I find it,
      I will digitize it and send you a copy. I do not recall there ever being
      a game for it though.</b><br>
      <br>
      Scott: According to the person I purchased the disc from, the race course
      footage I have was done at the Malibu Grand Prix driving center in Redwood
      City, CA, so I'm not sure if there were 2 different games that were based
      on actual footage, or if they're both the same game.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I think they tried a few times to get good footage, and did Malibu
      because the other footage was crap and Malibu was nearby. For our Malibu
      we went to the real one in Redwood City and filmed a bunch of stuff so
      the vector game would look better too, but not with all that equipment
      they show. But remember, this was a LONG time ago, and also around the
      time I left Atari.</b><br>
      <br>
      Scott: As for the DVD, just lmk the address to send it to. Regarding the
      test discs you have, if you can transfer them to VHS that would be fine.
      I'd be reluctant to send the original discs out as well. I'll gladly cover
      the costs both ways (let me know if you need any blank tapes). It's the
      *least* I can do, considering how much I've enjoyed some of your games
      over the years :). Besides, if the DP guys heard I let you pay for anything,
      I'd never hear the end of it.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: No worries, I will be happy to. Would you prefer it on a DVD?
      Might be easier for me. I have a Pioneer DVD recorder connected to my laser
      disk, so I am willing to do that.<br>
      <br>
      I am copying this to my website, so other can read the questions and answers,
      so I will send an address in a separate message.</b><br>

      I first played Major Havoc in 1985 at Dudley's draw at Texas A&M as a student
      and have been looking for a machine for a long time.<br>
      <br>
      Do you have any idea where I can get one or how to get a copy to play on
      my PC?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: As for getting a real Major Havoc, watch Ebay and talk to local
      arcades if any exist. They are VERY hard to find these days.<br>
      <br>
      As for playing on your PC, I have posted this info on the site. Follow
      the links to MAME. You can also Google for “Mame” and then spend some time
      searching the net for game ROMS. Again, they are hard to find, and if you
      get stuck, let me know and I will see what I can do to get you a copy of
      the ROMS for MAME for Major Havoc.<br>

      MAME is an emulator that plays the REAL game, not a copy or knock off of

      <hr>
      <br>
      From John Greve:<br>
      <br>
      Hello.....just wanted to take a moment to say hello and tell you how much
      I enjoy your old arcade games Space Duel and Major Havoc.I own both of
      these arcade games among roughly 20 others. My Major Havoc is a Space Duel
      conversion....(.sorry about that particular Space Duel but I do own and
      play another! :) Also own a Battlezone which is alot of fun but gets to
      hard to fast for me anyway so I don't get much higher than 50,000 points
      or so.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: No worries about the conversion. It happened to a LOT of Space
      Duels actually way back when. At least it was converted to another game
      of mine! :-)</b><br>
      <br>
      I've never been able to figure out how the warping thing works when your
      in the Breakout screen on MH.I've searched online for an answer as well
      but have been unsuccessful as well so I thought that I'd go to the "horses
      mouth" as it were....Can you enlighten me on this?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: As you play through the game, messages appear on the tactical
      screen (where you enter the warp code) that will tell you the codes. I
      believe (I am not sure) that when you reach level 4, you will see a message
      that says something like "Intercepted message, Warp code for level 3 is
      23" in bright flashing letters at the top of the tactical screen (what
      you call the break out screen).<br>
      <br>
      There are 4 codes all together, unless you are playing the "Return to Vax" version
      created by a fan, which I think has 6 codes.<br>
      <br>
      Each warp code also has a color to help you know which one you are entering.<br>
      <br>
      If you have not died, you can enter a warp code on the "breakout" screen
      while the screen is being displayed. You need to be fast though, and entering
      the correct number will give you a bit more time to enter the next. The
      first two warp codes are only two digits each, so you can take 100 guesses
      if you like as well. The second 2 warp codes are 3 digits each, so guessing
      will not be so easy.<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, when you enter the breakout screen, spinning the roller will change
      a digit. Pressing FIRE will lock in the number displayed, and move to the
      next digit. Spin the wheel again, pick the next digit, and press fire again
      (come to think of it, it might be the shield button, I do not recall...but
      one of the buttons will lock it in). If you get the right code, you will
      IMMEDIATELY jump to the "breakout" screen of that level, where you can
      again enter the next warp code, and continue to warp to level 12 (again,
      I think), the highest place you can warp to.<br>
      <br>
      As I said, as long as you have not lost a life, the warp entry will be
      available to the NEXT highest location. For example, if you make it through
      the first 3 waves to level 4 and have not lost a life, for the first waves,
      you will be given then opportunity to enter the first warp. If you make
      as far as the first warp would have taken you and have not died, then you
      can enter the second warp, etc, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The first warp code is 23. Give it a try. You need to be fairly fast though,
      as a timer starts when you enter that "breakout" screen, and you only have
      a small time to enter the proper code.<br>
      <br>
      The reason for warps was to give a good player the ability to skip waves
      they no longer wanted to play, and get straight to the higher levels. I
      believe it also awards you points for each warp, an "average" score for
      someone who would have played the previously skipped waves so that you
      are not playing level 13 with not points.<br>
      <br>
      Hope this helps.</b><br>
      <br>
      MH is a absolute blast to play....I have a coupla boardsets cause the audio
      is dead on one but I do notice some different video on one of the boards.Some
      of the enemy shots are different shapes and have more color in them.I also
      noticed that on this particular board when the spaceship explodes there
      are wireframe shaped pieces that come towards you similar to what you'd
      see in Space Duel.My other board just has the sparkly effect when the ship
      explodes.I've never looked at the revision # on the chips yet as it's a
      huge pain getting to the back of the machine.At any rate I was surprised
      to see the differences.Oh...and it seems that there is a starfield in the
      background as well.The other game just has a black empty space background.So
      all those changes are neat to see!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Strange! I wonder if you have an old board? Does the game play
      the same?<br>
      <br>
      If you are not seeing the star field, maybe that board requires the brightness
      to be turned up? The pieces that come towards you when the ship explodes
      are always there. Usually green pieces. Is it possible that the green output
      is dead on that board? Do you see the small maze at the top and other "green" items.
      Do you see white, is is everything yellow, red and purple?<br>
      <br>
      I do not recall any major changes in released boards. We did ONE fix on
      a higher up level where the automatic hand turns the reactor back to safe
      and closes the exit door. Seems you could get out before the door closed,
      and then play that same level over and over this way for large points,
      as everything destroyed in the maze stayed destroyed! We did make a minor
      release to fix that. So, could the older board be a prototype? And if so,
      how could I get a copy of the ROM images?</b><br>
      <br>
      Well that's it for now don't want to take up to much of your time.Thanks
      again for the inspiration that became Major Havoc and I look forward to
      hearing from you.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Thanks John. It was a fun game to do. A lot of the ideas and inspiration
      credit also must go to Lyle Rains, who created the art for the game, especially
      Havoc, and thus gave him his character, and Mark Cerny for designing the
      flying fish space wave, and the last 4 or so space waves, and a LOT of
      work on making the whole thing come together as well. Both are very creative
      people who put a lot of their time, creativity, and energy into this game
      as well. Part of me wishes we did it as a raster game, it probably would
      have been SO much more successful.<br>

      <br>
      Many thanks for putting up all that information on your site, it's a fascinating
      read - the glowing magic of the video games were really the heralds of
      a new age and I guess the people who wrote those early games are living

      I'd love to ask you a bit more about SAC-II if you don't mind? I know you've
      got the Shrike Avenger page up there, and apart from that, the MAME driver,
      and what I can barely make out on a scanned flyer, I think that's probably
      all the documentation that there is publicly available.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: You have what I have seen...but I will try to help...</b><br>
      <br>
      There's some general information that would be really intesting, I guess
      it might be hard to clarify as there was apparently only the one game produced
      on the hardware, so SAC-II is virtually synonymous with Shrike. I'd be
      curious as to whether the motion controlled cockpit actually an integral
      part of the SAC-II hardware, or was it an add-on specifically for Shrike?
      Were there any other features that distinguished it from SAC-I? Did Bally
      Sente retain all the prototypes, or is it possible that there is one or
      more in private ownership? I would suspect that if they were all protos
      there is then no published/printed documentation available for SAC-II?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: There were two systems in that motion control unit. The regular
      SAC system which played the game, and a 68000 based motion control computer.
      The game played like any SAC game, but we may have had extra pages in the
      ROM cartridge for the graphics.<br>
      <br>
      I did not write the software for the motion control computer. My game simply
      sent commands to that system via a mapped address and that computer moved
      the simulator. I recall some of the info, but not a lot. We had several
      methods on that machine to keep the simulator from running off the end.<br>
      <br>
      The simulator was two "ball screws" on one end driven by stepper motors
      and a "u-joint" JUST like the one you would find in a Corvette for the
      game cabinet to pivot about. I could drive each screw up and down independently
      to achieve the motion I wanted. Not exactly 3D motion, but I got some good
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      The motion computer would initialize the box by first slowly testing the
      limits of the motion. We had 2 switches on each end of each actuator. The
      design was to stop the motion of the first switch closed, and reverse the
      motion if the second switch closed, meaning you ran too far past the first
      switch. To test the limits, we would move the actuators to the low limit
      until it hit the first switch and stop. We would then slowly move to the
      other limit, counting the number of steps to the motors needed to hit the
      limit switch on the "up" end. The software would use these counts to never
      ask the simulator to go beyond these positions. If I recall, my software
      in the SAC let me know control the simulator by requesting a "numbered" position
      from 0 (all the way down) to "n", all the way up for each actuator. The
      idea was that we would never run one of the motion actuators off the end,
      thus dumping the game cabinet on the floor. (Sad news was that when it
      was first worked on before I started my work on it, that actually happened
      EVEN with all these protections. The damn thing moved fast and even the
      auto reverse was not fast enough to stop it from going over once. We later
      added steel cables as well JUST in case it happened again, which it did
      not.)</b><br>
      <br>
      Did SAC-II disappear purely because of the cost? The best I can make out
      is that Shrike was Copyright 1986, and I think you mentioned the place
      was closed around 1987 - did SAC-II disappear because of the closure?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: It was WAY too expensive for the day, I think around $10k. For
      that time, that was VERY costly. The other problem was that it was expensive
      to build, move, and ship. Lastly, it was VERY costly to maintain. With
      all those moving parts, it broke a lot. I am sure the closure of Sente
      was part of the issue, but Bally continued and if successful, it could
      have been made there.<br>
      <br>
      I was asked about two years later by one of Bally's customers in Italy
      to build another game for the simulator. Had I still had access to the
      source and development environment, I would have, but alas, that never
      happened. In reality, the Shrike Avenger program was never finished either.
      The game was started by Jim Turner, who left Bally Sente. The game was
      not very far along, and I was only given about 6 weeks to turn it into
      something. The graphics were done, and I had to make something work. I
      chose to model the game after Last Starfighter actually, but never got
      to finish it. The game was to be a practice round shooting at small targets,
      then a long round of shooting at attacking ship (the game you play now)
      and then you were going to have to go against the "mother ship" and shoot
      out 4 engines and then the target array to win the round. Given the time,
      I tried to do something fun, but the actual play never really developed.
      There was going to be a "death blossom" shot you could use once that would
      have been a wild ride as well, but that motion was VERY tough in the simulator,
      do I did not complete it.</b><br>
      <br>
      I find it hard to visualise the hardware - as you probably do too 20 years
      later! I assumed from the description on the flyer that the two motor drives
      were x,y drives for yaw and pitch, however the diagnostics screens refer
      to "l motor" and "r motor", does this mean that the cockipt rotated about
      the vertical axis and did not pitch? Or maybe rocked from side to side?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Very close. The two actuators were in the back in the left and
      right, with a U-joint in the front. If I moved the two actuators at the
      same time, the cabinet rocked forward and backward, basically pitch. If
      I went up on 'l' and down on 'r,' then the cabinet essentially went "roll" right,
      with an obvious backward pitch since the rotation point was always around
      the u-joint in the front. The opposite direction "rolled" left. Marketing
      could call them what they wanted, and we got some very cool motions by
      playing with the timing of the motors, including a circular motion which
      felt like yaw.</b><br>
      <br>
      I hope you don't mind me asking all this stuff? There's plenty more I can
      think of, but I'll try and figure some out from the motor controller ROM
      :)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Ask away! I'll do my best to answer. I do not know the hardware
      of the motion side, but I did work on it for a while. Hope these answers
      are of some help.</b><br>

      <br>
      I don't believe I've ever emailed you, but my name is Mitch Rohde and I
      am an engineer and arcade game collector that lives in Ann Arbor, MI. I
      was scanning your webpage and noticed you had worked on Triple Hunt back
      in the day.<br>
      <br>
      I wanted to question one of the notes you have on the page. I have been
      restoring an upright Triple Hunt on and off for a couple years -- the one-piece
      dedicated version. From what I can tell it supports all three games, not
      just Witch Hunt. The machine came with all the art inserts (control panel,
      backgrounds, etc) and several 8-track tapes. SO - I was surprised with
      your comment that the one-piece was only Witch Hunt.<br>
      <br>
      Any thoughts?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Very cool, please send us pictures.<br>
      <br>
      Did I really say that, or did someone quote me wrong? (looking...)<br>
      <br>
      I think the upright was only originally supposed to be a Witch Hunt. It
      is possible that someone took the graphics from a two piece when it died
      and put them in this game. But it was so long ago, I do not recall any
      more.<br>
      <br>
      I would love to get a CD copy of the audio on the 8-track tapes as well.
      If you are so inclined, please take pics and audio capture and email them
      to me please.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for the message, and the correction. It is possible it was a changeable
      unit, and I never knew.</b><br>
      <br>
      Good to hear from you. You may be right on the leached graphics, etc from
      another machine -- very hard to tell. I haven't been able to find ANY original
      Atari docs covering the upright one-piece, which is a little odd. In terms
      of the audio, I actually did digitize it last year but have yet to clean
      it up. You can d/l them from this guy: http://arcadearchive.com/em/sound/index.htm
      and someone else is using these to make repro 8-tracks for the machines.<br>
      <br>
      I actually had my sister-in-law (graphic artist) recreate the control panel
      art in illustrator so I could print a new overlay for my rusted one. They
      came out excellently, and I am in the process of rebuilding the rest of
      the control panel...<br>
      <br>
      I'm pretty into collecting the older stuff - 70s, etc., and have a few
      of your games (the Triple, Major Havoc, etc). Ah, your those were the days..<br>
      <br>
      Please let me know if you find anything more definitive out about the one-piece.
      I'd love to know. (Also love to get a 2-piece sometime!) <br>
