      Added a few pictures for <a href="tunhunt.html">Tunnel Hunt </a>/ Tube Chase Marquee. The Tube Chase
          Marquee is a picture I took of the original maquee for the prototype
          game. The Tunnel Hunt marquee is courtesy of Mitchell Rohde, who has
          one
	  of the games, and was kind enough to take a picture, which I cleaned up
          in Photoshop for here. Also added a Marquee picture for
          <a href="orbit.html">Orbit</a>, <a href="skydiver.html">Skydiver</a>, and <a href="spaceduel.html">Space Duel</a>, and a few new Space Duel and Orbit
          Cabinet pictures as well. I also added these marquees to the stories
          page.
          I hope to
          get
          as many
          pictures
          as I can
          for each
          of the
          games
          listed. Sadly, 
	  some where never built, so they will not have images. </font></p>
	    <p><font color="#ffffff">Also added new images for <a href="shrike.html">Shrike Avenger,</a> <a href="gghost.html">Goalie

        Hi all. I am back. Yes, I know, it has been a few years since thie
          site wss updated, and my apologies for that. Seems Brian, my old site
          manager got
          tired of doing it! Actually, just kidding, he really got busy with
          other things, and this was, after all, just a hobby for him. Thanks
          Brian for all
          the hard work and making the site so cool. But now I have to step up.
          So I have taken over the code myself, and I will try and make updates
          here as
          soon as possible. But you can help. Send me some email (see botton
          of page) and ask questions, and I will answer. It makes it a lot more
          fun too. Hope
          to hear from you as well. <br>

        Owen attended California Extreme last weekend, and site friend Francis
          Mariani just happened to be there also. Francis sent along a couple
          of photos of
          Owen playing his creation, Space Duel, as well as a shot of (left to
          right in bottom picture) Owen with Al Alcorn (Atari legend, creator
          of Pong) and
          Walter Day, Official Scorekeeper of Twin Galaxies and a legend in his
          own right. Good stuff!<br>

    Added some "lost" emails that Owen sent along- one of which talks in detail
    about Shrike Avenger, the motion simulator game Sente was working on back
    in 1986 that was never released. And some good stuff about the warp codes
    and other details in Major Havoc. I've also added a new email about Triple
    Hunt and the mystery of the single-game upright version... hmmm... Jump over
    to the Mailbag and check it out!!<br>
    <br>
    I've also removed any broken links and fixed the others. I'll be adding some
    new ones as I sort through the myriad of links I've gathered over the years.
    Enjoy this update!<br>

    Wow! 2 1/2 years since the last update! As you may have noticed, the color
    scheme has changed to signify that work has resumed on the site by your extremely
    busy webmaster. A ton of life-changing things have happened over the past
    couple of years, and Owen himself has been extremely busy with his career.
    Hence, why the site has fallen into tertiary mode over the past couple of
    years. But, never you worry! The site is undergoing a complete redesign to
    bring it up to modern standards, and some new features will be added as the
    redesign commences. Over the next few days, I'll be adding some mail that
    Owen has forwarded me over time, and some broken or otherwise dead links
    will be fixed. That should keep you all a bit busy while the site transforms.
    Meanwhile, keep checking back for more updates.- Brian<br>
