      I spent almost 18 months working on Major Havoc. For Major Havoc, Doug
      Snyder beefed up the hardware, added some new special effects -- like a
      vector that sparkled -- and another processor, and we created a game that
      had a very strange cult following. To this day, I still receive regular
      emails and phone calls about the game. There is one person who is even
      creating more levels for the coin-op game by disassembling the code by
      hand.<br>
      <br>
      Most games used one 6502, but Major Havoc had a pair. It was originally
      designed to have three processors because we thought we would do as much
      real-time 3D as possible. Even with "this much processor power," as my
      boss once said, there was no way to calculate objects on the fly, so the
      third processor was left off. And hidden line removal for 3D objects was
      impossible. So to do a rotating 3D object with hidden lines, I drew the
      object by hand, then removed all the hidden vectors by hand. The resultant
      picture was then translated, by hand, back into a new set of vectors that
      would draw that object.<br>
      <br>
      Animation was also done by hand. Each step in the 3D animation was drawn
      and edited to create the desired effect. This was quite time consuming,
      but there were few alternatives. We later wrote programs on the same PDP-11
      we used to assemble our programs to do some of this 3D and hidden line
      work for us at night. But by today’s standards, it was quite slow. Calculations
      for the fighter spaceship in Major Havoc took all night, and we are really
      only talking about an object with 200 to 300 vectors and 50 different positions
      to be drawn. In fact, it took so long that a later change in the design
      of the ship was not completely rerendered, so if you watch closely, the
      ship actually changes design as it flies onto the screen.<br>
      <br>
      I was already a year into Major Havoc when Mark Cerny joined the team.
      He had (I guess still does have) a HUGE ego. Even though he was very new
      at Atari at the time, he said he would not work on the game unless he got
      an even say. I really did not care so I agreed. He worked on one of the
      space waves (the flying fish) and the last 4 base ship mazes. He also added
      some objects to the mazes (Like the gun and floating boots) and helped
      clean up old items that never got shipped. We actually worked quite well
      together. It was a lot of fun working with him, he really IS that good!<br>

      There are a million stories about Major Havoc all over the web. Here are
      a few examples:<br>
