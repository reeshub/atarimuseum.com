      Triple Hunt had a half silvered mirror and the game graphics (simple shapes
      and objects) were displayed on the screen and showed up OVER the background
      graphics. We added a monitor mask that made the graphics seem to disappear
      when they went behind things (like the bear walking behind a tree for example)
      and the effect was great. Since hardware was not so advanced, it made witches
      look like they were flying out of the windows as well. The other cool part
      is that the gun recorded a hit by seeing the light from the screen when the
      trigger was pulled. If the object was masked, you could not hit it.<br>
      <br>
      Witch Hunt was an upright dedicated version of ONE of the games from Triple
      Hunt. Triple Hunt had three games, and it seems that most arcades left it
      in Witch Hunt, it was the most popular. The biggest problem was the size
      of the game and how much space it took. I recall the building of the dedicated
      game, I just never knew they sold any.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible however that the game was sold in Europe and never released
      in the US, that happened to a few titles. So I recall it being created, just
      do not remember it it being sold. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">The screen shots on the top right are the screen view only. These were displayed behind a half-silvered mirror and as
        such had much more detail created by the bezel graphic elements. The shots with the graphics are shown at the bottom. </font></p>
