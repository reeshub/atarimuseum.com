      If you have a question for me, feel free to send it to owen-at-orubin-dot-com.
      I can't promise that EVERY question will be put on these pages, but I'll
      post as many as possible!<br>

      Q: Hi,cool stuff about your atari expirence but my question is how do you
      think up this original game ideas and how you think up that sound stuff
      like the splash of a towel<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Some people use to say we were all on strange drugs, and for some
      people at Atari that would have been true. Not me, didn't do them!<br>
      <br>
      I am not trying to sound conceited, but I think it just takes a creative
      or artistic mind to think up crazy solutions to strange problems. And to
      be honest, there are a lot more creative people than I out there. But I
      can come up with clever ideas as well. And, usually you do not do it yourself,
      and accepting that is often difficult for people to handle so they try
      and fail. It takes more than one person to make a great game (usually.)<br>
      <br>
      Game ideas go through many revisions and changes before the public ever
      seems them. More often than not, the old Atari games that got published
      were not the ideas that they started out to be. Major Havoc started out
      as a game called Tholian Web, named after an old Star Trek episode where
      the ship was caught by other ships that locked the ship into a web. You
      can see part of that original game in the third space wave actually. Tempest
      actually started out as a 3D version of Space Invaders! There are lots
      of other examples actually.<br>
      <br>
      Basically, you come up with a game idea, you get people together to "brain
      storm" about the idea, come up with additional ideas (the rule of a brain
      storm has to be NO NEGATIVE COMMENTS, only positive ideas) and then idea
      starts taking shape and growing. Then a prototype game is created with
      simple graphics, and more changes and ideas evolve. Major Havoc took almost
      18 months from concept to ship (believe it or not) to be good enough to
      put out. Other games I did I used an existing idea from another game and
      those I did in 8 weeks!<br>
      <br>
      As far as the sound, I needed a splat sound. I tried a lot of things that
      just did not work. One morning I was in the shower, I dropped the wash
      cloth and I thought: Paper Towels would work great!<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      From Mark Alpiger:<br>
      <br>
      Q: I saw your web site from a link on VG-Network. I love Atari's classic
      games, and really like Sente too (tho they had a number of titles that
      were too off-the-wall / off-topic for me - read, 'duds' / sports). Four
      of my top-five all-time favorites are from these two companies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Actually, I am not a big sports fan, but thought Hat Trick was
      a great game. The other early games from Sente were cool, but very strange
      in some cases.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Q: By the way, my friend... Kelly, and I used to joke about all the
      bugs in Atari's games, especially after the Paperboy debacle !! Of course,
      even Major has the classic 'logic error' with the finger 'trick', tho I
      consider this less severe than a bug (like Paperboy). What did you think
      about that trick, when you first heard of it ??<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: You make it sound like it was a bug! :-) Actually, in some cases
      we added these "Easter eggs" on purpose. In the case of MH, I overlooked
      something and it should not have happened (the finger). I actually laughed
      when someone told me about it, and knew EXACTLY why it happened. I was
      more embarrassed that it could happen than it did. It was an easy fix.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Q: Oh, one last thing; do you know anything about the designer of
      Snakepit, one of my faves ?? Any stories on it ?? That's one great game...
      OK, now, this is the last thing; what do you call the control on Major
      Havoc; did you have an 'official' name for it ?? I'll tell you what I think
      it should be called when I hear from you and write back...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I believe Lee Actor was the creator of snake pit (or was it Dave
      Ross?). Lee was one of the first programmers at Sente, and one of the last
      to leave. He also did Hat Trick and several other games for Sente, and
      when I moved there I got to know him well. He still designs games as part
      of his own company (they contract out to do games for other companies)
      but really does not need to. He did some great games "behind the scenes" for
      other companies and became quite wealthy doing it. He is mostly retired
      now. With a major in music, he is doing some playing with symphony.<br>
      <br>
      I have no stories, that was before my Sente time. I do remember when they
      were going to announce it at one trade show, but I believe it was not ready.
      So all the team was standing around a draped cabinet, wearing buttons that
      said "No Comment". That was funny.<br>
      <br>
      We called the roller control a "whirlygig" if I remember correctly. But
      I believe they also called the knob on tempest the same thing occasionally.
      Don't know if it had a "real" name. It was simply a one dimensional track
      ball!<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      From Mark Longridge (Hi Mark! How's the cube collecting going?):<br>
      <br>
      Q: Hi Owen!<br>
      <br>
      I have been always fascinated by Atari games in general and Dig Dug in
      particular. I see you mention you have a Dig Dug prototype, but what does
      that mean, it's the first Dig Dug, or the first Dig Dug made in North America?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Namco sent the game to Atari to "convert" it from Japanese to
      English, and make some minor changes. I recall helping some on the conversion
      at the time, but for the life of me remember very little.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Q: I know the original game was programmed by Namco Japan, but I was
      never able to figure out who had the source code, or who programmed the
      original japanese version. I wanted to ask the programmer's why all the
      monsters freez on Dig Dug on round 136 (in later rounds they move turtle
      slow). Why did that Atari guy change Dig Dug? It seems to play just about
      identical to the japanese rom...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I do not recall if we had the source or had to reverse engineer
      the changes we wanted. Could not answer this.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Q: Jed Margolin told me that Atari didn't go to great pains to archive
      the source code of their old coin-op games. Did you keep the source code
      for the games you wrote? I finally understand why vector games were used
      in the early days, better resolution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Actually, not entirely true. ALL games were backed up onto tape
      on the Vax computer we used. Until recently, I still had a whole box of
      tapes from Sente, but they got ruined in a flood, and I could not find
      people to read old TU-78 Vax tapes anyway. I did keep a few printouts of
      games I worked on, LARGE binders of paper in my garage. The Major Havoc
      listings were used to help the guys working on the Mame clone for Major
      Havoc, and I used the Tunnel Hunt sources to help the author on the Mame
      version of that as well.<br>
      <br>
      And yes, vector had better resolution, but just looked cool too!<br>
      <br>
      </b> Q: You guys did some very very good work on those early machines.
      When I think about how slow the hardware was, and how little memory the
      games had... of course the hardware was designed to only play that particular
      game, but still, real time 3d, like that game Battlezone, incredible. But
      I must ask, who would know who programmed Dig Dug?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Sorry, no idea on this. Funny though, I often wondered how the
      idea came about. Makes me wonder if something got lost in the translation.
      Some execs probably said "Make a game where the hero blows things up!" Poor
      translation I suspect! :-)<br>
      <br>
      </b> Q: Just wanted to say thanks, it must have been quite an experience
      in the late 70's working at Atari.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: It was for me. My first job out of college and then doing games
      for the next 12 to 13 years. It was a lot of fun. Thanks for the message.<br>
      <br>
      </b>
      <hr>
      <br>
      From Scott Burton:<br>
      <br>
      Q: I read your letter in the mailbax of classicgaming.com. I agree with
      you. > Games of the 80's were (and are) much better in quality and gameplay
      than the arcade games of today. It appears that gameplay is sacrificed
      for graphics and sound. With the games of the 80's, you could go on forever
      with one quarter/token (asteroids, ms pac-man, space duel, etc). Now, they
      intentionally make games nothing more than quarter munchers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Thanks, obviously you know how I feel. But with lousy graphics
      and sounds, we had to have a good game play, and it was important to give
      people their money's worth. Would you believe that we wanted games to last
      90 seconds on average though? Its true. But good players were rewarded
      with longer games.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Q: I remember playing the breakout subgame within Major Havoc. What
      there any secrets to that or was it just to rack up bonus points. Also,
      what were the differences between Major Havoc and the Return to Vax?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: If you got all the bricks, you get a free life, and some points
      as well. That was it, it was just me being obnoxious. After all, what else
      would a good space fighter do during travel times between battles? Play
      video games! :-)<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      From Norbert Kehrer (author of Java Space Duel, among other emulators):<br>
      <br>
      Q: Hi Owen,<br>
      <br>
      thanks for putting up such a great site. Being a great fan of the old vector
      games, I am totally impressed. Especially the stories and the pictures
      of the Atari team are very cool.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: If I find more, I will put them up. I know I have some shots of
      a bunch of Atari people hanging around Nolan's pool! :-)<br>
      <br>
      </b> Q: How about some information about the things that you and the other
      Atari programmers are doing today. I know that not everybody likes it,
      that such recent and personal information about him is online, but I think
      it would be really interesting for all classic arcade fans.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I cannot speak for others, they would have to do that. But for
      me:<br>
      <br>
      I left Atari and went to work for Bally Sente until they closed it 3+ years
      later. I joined Rob Fullop (from Atari) to help create a start-up doing
      combined graphics and live video, long before they called it "multimedia." I
      also helped design a system there that AOL (it was then called Quantum
      Link) used to create on-line games that were written once, but played on
      PCs, Commodores, Macs, and Apple IIs. Rob Fullop's Rabbit Jack's Casino
      game for AOL was built on the system. I left there shortly after and joined
      Apple as an engineer working on new Mac designs, Mac software, and all
      around Mac generalists (after doing a bunch of Apple II stuff for them
      first.) After almost 7 years at Apple, I did a short stint at Berkeley
      Systems, then moved on to Pacific Bell, where I was a technical director
      on their broadband system for cable TV, high speed cable data, video on
      demand, and interactive TV. Unfortunately, even though it worked VERY well
      and we were ready to deploy it in California, after 5 years, SBC bought
      Pac Bell and shut it down, the fools. We would have had a system WAY ahead
      of ANYTHING available in the world really, and this was in 1995! I left
      there and went to work for Paul Allen's think tank research center in Palo
      Alto called Interval Research as his Broadband Research Lead. But Interval
      closed the next year, so I moved to yet another Interactive TV company
      called NetTV (now Lumenati) where were building a set top box based on
      PC parts, and a cool interactive video/audio player for the PC. But I did
      not feel as if I fit (that is a long story itself), so I have since joined
      my old boss from Pacific Bell at a new start-up doing some highly secretive
      stuff in electronics where I am the VP of Engineering for a software division
      of the company.<br>

      <br>
      From Curt Vendel, webmaster of Atari-History.Com<br>
      <br>
      Q: Among all of your amazing designs and creations, I personally would
      love to see the robot you designed and built while at Atari.... can you
      put up some photo's and a detailed story behind it?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Believe it or not, I still have it in the garage, and unfortunately,
      while it still boots up, many of the parts have given out, so he does not
      run as well as he used to. If I get some free time, I may try and restore
      it again.<br>
      <br>
      But to be fair, I did not build it. This was designed and built by the
      Grass Valley group of Atari. I "rescued" it and started making changes
      and programming additions to the design. I added and enabled many of the
      sensors for the guy, and basically kept him running. I was told that this
      was an inspiration to Nolan Bushnell for Petsters, a company he founded
      that sold small, inexpensive pet robots (I wanted to attach a picture of
      the cat version, but none of my new Macs will transfer from the camera...need
      a serial port, and Belkin adapter does not work!)<br>
      <br>
      He is called Kermit, and I will get some photos of him posted as soon as
      I can. Thanks for asking about it. How did you find out about it?</b> <br>
