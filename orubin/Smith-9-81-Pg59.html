                also people who have taken courses in physics. What we found
                reflects the problem with designing cyclotrons: it's easy to
                find people who know the equations, but it's harder to find people
                who have incorporated that knowledge into their intuition of
                the world.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;For me,&quot; Papert adds, &quot;it's
                clear with students, even at MIT where they're pre-selected for
                being 'good at' science and math. The fact that they've done
                a year or two of undergraduate physics doesn't mean they've taken
                it into their intuition. They know the equations, but when you
                put them into situations where they've got to act rather than
                use equations, it's not just that they fall back on Newton, but
                they fall back on Aristotle.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">The computer language called Logo
                that Papert developed and used to create this game was marketed
                this summer by Texas Instruments for use on its home computers.
                Papert is now advising Logo Computer Systems, a new company which
                is developing versions of the language for other home computers
                and for use in schools. Similarly powerful simulations, using
                a computer language called Smalltalk, have been developed at
                the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, where children have been
                animating Saturday morning cartoons instead of watching them,
                designing music and playing with electronic paint brushes. Alan
                Kay, who directed this research, predicts that home computers
                that allow kids to do this sort of thing will be on the market,
                at no higher cost than the current ones, within this decade.
                And they will be no larger than a school notebook.</font></td>

    <td width="50%" valign="top"><font face="Times New Roman">Such predictions
        have been made before and failed to materialize, but&quot; it is clear
        that the microcomputer has got out of the arcade. &quot;The friendly
        computer is not something that's going to happen,&quot; Isaac Asimov
        points out, &quot;it is happening. It's all around us, the games, appliances,
        the word-processor instead of the typewriter. It's the new age, and it
        is here.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the new age is anywhere, it may be in
          the spare, modern office of Steven Jobs, who with his partner Stephen
          Wozniak invented the Apple computer. On the wall is a sort of computer
          sampler, the word &quot;THINK&quot; generated in colors of the electronic
          spectrum. There's an Apple computer beside his desk. The office is
          in striking contrast to the slicker aura that surrounds it, with a
          steady coming and going of Silicon Valley executives and sales reps
          in brass-buttoned blazers, carrying brass-bound briefcases, their faces
          chiseled out of the sun. Steve Jobs kicks his leather sandals off.
          He&quot; wears faded jeans and a western corduroy shirt with sleeves
          rolled up.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Steve and his partner &quot;Woz&quot; may
          be remembered as the two college dropouts who brought the computer
          down to earth. &quot;Most people's view of it is still 1984ish,&quot; he
          says, &quot;and yet the way it's really happening is closer to whole-wheat
          bread! Instead of leading to centralized intelligence, centralized
          decision-making and personal unenrichment, it's started happening on
          a personal scale.&quot; If the computer is becoming decentralized,
          cheap and more accessible to the individual, Steve and Woz had a lot
          to do with all that.</font></p>
      <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Making the computer adapt to people</font></em></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Five years ago they decided to make their
          own computer because they couldn't afford to buy one. &quot;I was working
          at Atari at the time and Woz worked at Hewlett-Packard designing calculators,&quot; Steve
          recalls, &quot;and we both liberated some parts and built our first
          computer in the garage of my house. Actually, we started working in
          a bedroom, but my parents kicked us out to the garage.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Apple was not the first personal computer,
          but it was the first popular one because it hooked up to a TV set,
          something Steve learned from Atari, an idea implicit in Nolan Bushnell's
          original inspiration. Steve sees the concept of games taking on new
          meaning as the computer evolves to meet us on our terms. &quot;The
          challenge,&quot; he says, &quot;is to spend more of the intelligence
          in the box to make the computer adapt to the way people do things rather
          than what we do now, which is to force people to adapt to the way computers
          do things.&quot; The sort of change Steve Jobs has in mind can already
          be seen at places like MIT, where an office-of-the-future project includes
          a computer you can communicate with by touching its screen, or talking
          to</font></td>
