                matches wits with an intelligent machine.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">They may also turn out to be more
                than that. With the continuing decrease in the cost of the hardware,
                the games have got more and more sophisticated. A recent Atari
                game called Battlezone has three processors running it. In order
                to play some of these games, many players develop styles of thinking
                and seeing that they do not ordinarily use.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">Out in the arcades now, MIT sociologist
                Sherry Turkic has been watching the players. &quot;I think they
                are learning a lot of spatial thinking, a lot of geometrical
                thinking,&quot; she says. &quot;What I see is an experience that
                great athletes have, where they can allow their bodies to think
                for them. The games are giving that experience to larger numbers
                of people. With good players their fingers are doing the thinking.&quot; The
                games are also teaching a lot of people that computers can be
                playful, she points out.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the Claremont Graduate School
                in a Los Angeles suburb, psychologist Robert S. Gable suspects
                that the players he sees in the arcades may be thinking with
                faculties even more surprising than their fingers. &quot;The
                game players are intellectual and social mutants,&quot; he says.
                He sees their play as a form of learning that may</font></td>

    <td width="50%" valign="top"><font face="Times New Roman">be more suited
        to the computer-based society that is emerging than the linear education
        now available in schools and books. &quot;The arcade machines are skillful
        teachers,&quot; Gable says, &quot;with more variety and individuality
        than many human teachers.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">His words are echoed by Michigan's James
          McConnell, whose introductory textbook on psychology is currently a
          best seller on college campuses. &quot;Go into one of the arcades and
          watch the students there play,&quot; McConnell advises. &quot;They're
          being challenged in strange sorts of ways, and they're vocal and emotional
          about it. And then go to the library, and watch the kids sitting in
          a row, and they aren't smiling and they aren't enjoying anything, and
          if they did, if one of them got an insight from reading a book and
          stood up and yelled 'Eureka!' they'd throw him right out of the place.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Are those psychologists saying the arcades
          are the new schools for survival? Is it somehow more valuable to learn
          Missile Command than to learn English?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">To know that, you may have to hit hyperspace.
          Hyperspace is a concept introduced in early science fiction and used
          in some of the first computer video games, whereby you disappear from
          your current frame of reference and reappear in the same world but
          in a different dimension of space or time, or at least at different
          coordinates on the screen. It is not a perfect concept. There's a chance
          you will blow up on reentry. But sometimes it's worth trying.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">.Hyperspace. And reenter in the weatherbeaten
          barracks office of Major Dave Robinson, a trim armored cavalry officer
          who, as he gets up from his desk, looks as if he might shoot right
          through his own flat-cut hair. Until recently, he says, the only video
          game he can recall playing was an early tank game, years ago in a bar.
          At the moment. Major Robinson is assigned to the Army Training Support
          Center at Fort Eustis, Virginia, a field office of TRADOC, the Army's
          Training and Doctrine Command, and his mission is to explore the effectiveness
          of a modified Atari arcade game in gunnery instruction.</font></p>
      <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">In the arcades, they're all volunteers</font></em></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Major Robinson's orders came down from
          the commander of TRADOC, General Donn Starry, who was struck by what
          he saw in the video game arcades. &quot;I see a lot of people in those
          arcades learning something,&quot; Robinson recalls the general's words, &quot;and
          they're all volunteers, and they're paying a quarter to learn whatever
          it is they learn from these machines. I don't know what they learn,
          but I'm convinced they learn something, and that the Army needs to
          exploit it.&quot; An Army study group selected the Atari game Battlezone
          as a candidate for training use, and Major</font></td>
