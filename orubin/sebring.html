      <b>Sebring - Atari Inc.<br>
      As Told By Jed Margolin</b><br>
      <br>
    </center>
    Sebring was developed in early 1979, ostensibly to use up a supply of 25" color
    monitors.<br>
    <br>
    It was a sitdown game with a curved projection mirror.<br>
    <br>
    The monitor was mounted on top of the cabinet.<br>
    <br>
    It was a first person game, using the stamp hardware that was used back then.<br>
    <br>
    The game designer/programmer was Owen Rubin, one of the great early game
    designers. Owen came up with several innovations that were copied by later
    generations of driving games:<br>
    <br>
    1. The player drove around a circular track; the hardware made it look like
    the objects that were farther away were smaller.<br>
    <br>
    2. The player saw the front of his own car, which shook as the car was driven.<br>
    <br>
    3. There were other cars on the track which the player had to get around.<br>
    <br>
    4. The player started the game by starting the engine, which started with
    a bang, a hardware bug that we liked, so we kept it in.<br>
    <br>
    5. There were probably more innovations of Owen that I have forgotten.<br>
    <br>
    The Hardware Engineer was Jed Margolin (me). Paul Mancuso was the tech. That
    was the entire team, aided only by Karen Bjorquist (assembler).<br>
    <br>
    The cabinet was designed by the Cabinet Department.<br>
    <br>
    Paul and I put a large speaker in the front of the seat, between the player's
    legs which gave the player a nice buzz from the engine sound. Years later,
    this feature was used by others, who patented it. (grrr).<br>
    <br>
    Although Sebring did very well in field test, it was cancelled because, supposedly,
    the vender who made Atari's cabinets didn't want to make it. (Perhaps he
    wanted too much money.)<br>
    <br>
    I believe there was only one prototype, last seen in Paul's possession.<br>
    <br>
    And that's the story of Sebring.<br>
    <br>
    You can read more about this game in a web interview with me that was conducted
    in 1998 by the Webmaster. Click <a href="orinterview.html" target="mainFrame">here</a> for
