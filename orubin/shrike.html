      Another game I took over. The person who was running the MIS/IT group was
      also designing this game. For reasons never fully clear, they decided I
      could do both those jobs completely (I was doing both jobs), and they decided
      to keep me doing them both rather than the other person. He was let go
      (I suspect there were other reasons I was never fully told about) and they
      gave me Shrike Avenger. Truth be told, this other person had been working
      on the game for quite some time, and it was not going anywhere.<br>
      <br>
      Shrike Avenger was a motion simulator game, a very cool cabinet. I was
      given 5 to 6 weeks to make it into a game, There was a ton of graphics
      and there was some thought it should be a Last Starfighter game (not officially
      of course) so I set out to make this work. I started the game with target
      drones, then a few fighters, then more fighters which are larger. You were
      SUPPOSED to attack the mother ship last, knock out the 4 engines and 8
      guns, and then hit it in the middle to blow it up. We never got the mother
      ship working because of time.<br>
      <br>
      But it was fun to toss people around every time a ship hit the player.<br>
      <br>
      There were a few problems. This was a BIG game. It had to large, very powerful
      linear actuators to move it. We had 4 to 6 safety devices on the motion
      system: 2 sets of hardware limit switches, software limits on motion, software
      readable limit switches, and safety cables. Yet after all that, we still
      managed to flip a game over and drop a kid almost on his head. Needless
      to say, given the cost, we did not build many.<br>
      <br>
      Shrike Avenger was one of the first games to charge $1.00 a game, and when
      we put it out on test at Great America, it earned VERY well! People played
      it ALL the time. And given that the park was not open as long as many arcades,
      and that people had already paid to get into the park, and that there were
      &quot;free&quot; roller coaster near by, I was surprised that it actually did as
      well as it did. <br>
