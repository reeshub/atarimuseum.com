    Tube Chase started very early as a vector game. I got the idea from the opening
    of the original Alien movie during the landing sequence. However, we could
    not do hidden line removal, and all those lines got very confusing. It went
    through several version of raster hardware from cool ellipses that could
    split, to the cheaper square hardware that we finally used, all called Tube
    Chase. It was killed and brought back at least 3 or 4 times at Atari under
    the same name. It became Vertigo when Exidy first took it, but they decided
    to pass on it when it did not test well at the arcades any more (at that
    time, it was only 3rd for 10 weeks!), and then finally Tunnel Hunt at Centuri.<br>

    You can read more about this game and it's evolution in a web interview with
    me that was conducted in 1998 by the Webmaster. Click <a href="orinterview.html">here</a> for
