        OK, it has been a long while since this site was updated. Unfortunately,
        Brian, who used to keep this site going for me got very busy with other
        things in his life, and I just did not jump in soon enough to take over.
        Sorry about that. And thank you Brian for all the good work, and feel
        free to drop by and make some changes anytime you like.<br>
        <br>
        So, time for me to take it over myself and add some new content. So,
        over the next few months, I will try and add some new content, and maybe
        even change it to a new site layout. I will just have to see how much
        time I have. In the meantime, look around, and send me an email. I will
        asnwer, and I will start posting email to the site again. And if you
        see any bad links, please let me know. Thanks. <br>
        <br>
        OK, now, a liitle about me: Yes, I used to work for Atari as one of the
        first coin-op game programmers. I created or worked on Major Havoc, Space
        Duel, and many other games (Cannonball, Sky Diver, Tube Chase, Tunnel
        Hunt, Sebring, Malibu Grand Prix, and others). I have posted some stories
        here, but if you want to see some new ones, simply ask a cool question
        about Atari in the early days, and up it goes.<br>
        <br>
        That's me in the picture at the right, standing next to the original
        Major Havoc Prototype. And believe it or not, it still runs! And yes,
        that is a Dig Dug prototype right behind me. I also have a Space Duel
        Cocktail as well, but the camera is actually sitting on it!<br>
        <br>
        Also, if you're a Macintosh or PC user (you will need a newer one with
        some power), try the game emulation pages. With the Mame game emulator,
        you can play the actual game right on your machine. See the links at
        the left for more info. (There is both a PC and Mac version that play
        the same game ROMS.<br>
        <br>
        Thanks for stopping by. And as always, feel free to drop me a line at
        any time using the contact link at the left.<br>
