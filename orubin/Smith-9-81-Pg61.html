              one thing. But computers bring together all that, plus they bring
              logic into it, and philosophy, information theory, all that. So
              to me, anyway, the computer represents the culmination of all Western
              rational thought into an artifact.</font>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And the people working on these
                computers possess a passion about the discovery and creation
                of something. It's not even the creation&#151;they know it's
                there, and it's sort of what Michelangelo expressed</font></td>
          <td width="50%" valign="top"><font face="Times New Roman">when he was
              sculpting: he would look at a big rock and say, 'My statue is inside
              there and I just have to get it out.' It's a passion that I have
              only seen matched in people pursuing what they consider to be the
              truth of their existence. It's the same purity of spirit I have
              experienced in monks. These people feel that it is going to be
              the one most incredible revolution in our lifetimes. It's going
              to dwarf everything else. We are on the cliff.&quot;</font></td>
