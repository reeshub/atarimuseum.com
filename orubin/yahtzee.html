      <b>Yahtzee - 1980 Atari Inc.<br>
      for the Atari 8-bit personal computers </b><br>
      <br>
      I am not sure if this game was ever released.<br>
      <br>
      This was actually written in FORTH (Thanks Steve Calfee), and I did this
      to get myself an Atari 800. I wanted Atari to pay for it, so I helped set
      up a
      deal where
      if we
      did
      a game for the consumer computer, we would geta unit. My game worked, was
      fun. BUT, we did not have the rights to Yahtzee so we could not ship it.
It may have gone out finally under the name &quot;5-Dice&quot;, as that was the final version.
