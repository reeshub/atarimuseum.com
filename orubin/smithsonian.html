      <b>A generation meets computers on the playing fields of Atari<br>

    This article was an expose' on the brainstorming of Atari programmers and
    the future of computing in general. There is a picture of several of us sitting
    in a lab playing a prototype game. I am the person in the picture who is
    actually playing the game, and I was also quoted anonymously in the article.
    Here is the picture in question:<br>

    The person in the glasses at the far right was Jeff Boscole, the game designer.
    The reason everyone is laughing in the picture was that I was tearing this
    game apart! I think I had commented that I was playing attack of the Killer
    IUDs or something like that. Ed Rotberg was the project lead, and had come
    up with a concept for a new version of Battlezone and Missile Command. You
    were supposed to drive the tank around and missiles would "pop-up" out of
    their silos and start counting down. You had to shoot them before they launched.
    You will note I am playing with Battlezone tank controls. On the screen were
    a bunch of Copper 7 IUD looking devices that would spin and "jump" about
    the screen. It looked like the designer was on a bad trip, and maybe he was,
    but it was complete nonsense, no game play, and complete garbage going on.
    And this after 6 months! It was NOT fun, and made no sense. It was more like
    a screen saver of strange shapes. The controls simply zoomed the image and
    rotated it in a circle, or caused it to slide left/right or up/down. Pressing
    the fire button caused some small little dots to fly out on the screen in
    no particular direction and do nothing as far as I could tell! It simply
    made no sense!<br>
    <br>
    This was my quote in the article: "For me," says another, "a tough day is
    trying to find those two little bugs in my game, so I spend hours playing
    it. Sometime, of course, you have to spend hours pushing a pencil. And for
    most people here, pushing a pencil is the most aggravating thing they could
    do."<br>
