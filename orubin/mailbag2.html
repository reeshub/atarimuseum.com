      From Matt Caswell (arpwell@yahooXXXXXXXX.net)<br>
      <br>
      Matt: Hi Owen,<br>
      <br>
      I found your site through Atariage.com's forums, and I have to say that
      I'm impressed with your site- not least of which is the fact that it was
      done with a Mac.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: You need to thank Brian Deuel for the site, he is the person who
      has created it and keeps it up to date. I am very appreciative of his on-going
      work, as he is doing this out of the kindness of his heart. (Thanks Brian)</b> <font color="ff0000">(My
      pleasure- B.)</font><br>
      <br>
      Matt: First, I wanted to thank you for creating Major Havoc, one of my
      all time favorite games. I wanted to ask you directly since nobody on the
      Atari Age forums knew, and/or never replied to my post about whether or
      not MH actually lands on Planet Vaxx. <font color="ff0000">(Actually, I
      answered this post on 1-7, but it was a little late -B.)</font> Is this
      possible? I would really appreciate an answer to this MOST important question.
      :)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Actually, the answer is NO! When we originally designed it, you
      were going to get to "A" home world every fourth wave. You will not along
      the left side of the screen during the "tactical scan" part of the game
      there are 4 dots and the edge of a planet, and as you move through the
      4 waves, the ship gets closer to the planet. Because of time, we never
      got the planet waves done.<br>
      <br>
      Then we thought that we would END the game with a large planet wave, that
      was Vaxx. It was designed on paper a bit, but again, time and ROM space
      kept us from doing it.<br>
      <br>
      I know, it says "Keep playing, the home world is near." I inserted a bunch
      of messages into the message table very early on in the game for each wave
      and never removed them later. So that message got left behind when the
      original design was to reach the home world.<br>
      <br>
      The wave was going to be like a ship wave, except after you fought ALL
      the enemies at the same time in space (web spinners, ships, fish, and lines)
      you would land on the planet. Inside the planet, just like a base ship
      would be ALL the objects you had seen before. The only difference was that
      you would have about 3 to 4 minutes of time to trigger 3 or 4 reactors,
      each of which would count down. The countdown was longer of course, but
      your time was limited by oxygen as usual (but lots more) and then the 180
      seconds of it takes each reactor to blow. (of course, if one blows, they
      ALL blow!) The maze was going to be VERY large, with lots of transporters,
      and it would take much time to learn. I am just sorry we never had time
      to finish that.<br>
      <br>
      There is a story going about that when the game was in the arcade, one
      person spent several thousands of dollars trying to find the home world.
      Seems he saw the message, and kept playing. We received a picture of a
      screen shot on level 56 (or close), which means that the last 4 waves were
      played over and over getting harder and harder, and as you know, you cannot
      start higher then level 12! This person was good. But they threatened to
      sue Atari for the thousands they spent playing the game looking for the
      end.<br>
      <br>
      I had left Atari by that time, and I understand that Atari sent him a check,
      and his own copy of the game.<br>
      <br>
      I never imagined a small message left in the game would cause such problems.
      *SIGH*<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for the question, it is a very good one!<br>
      <br>

      From Rob Carroll (robert.carroll30@verizonXXXXXXX.com):<br>
      <br>
      Rob: I am a collector of 80's coin ops. The two biggest conributions of
      yours in my game room (that I know of), are my BZ with the erupting volcano
      and my newly-acquired Major Havoc.<br>
      <br>
      Major Havoc is a game with a history for me, as are nearly all the games
      in my collection. As a younger boy (I'm 28 now, probably 11 or so at the
      time), I distinctly remember playing it at a movie theater (the Satuit
      Playhouse in Scituate, Massachusetts, as it so happens, and I think it
      was a dedicated because I vaguely remember the roller-controller). Sadly,
      the next time I visited this movie theater, MH was gone. Probably replaced
      with a Konami Jailbreak or something (imagine the horror??) But I read
      a long article in one of the current gaming rags of the day, and it always
      stuck with me. Major Havoc was the game I only played once (before MAME)
      but could never forget. From the day I started my collection, MH was a
      game I intended to own. Now, thanks to my wife, this dream is realized.
      Merry Christmas to me. :^)<br>
      <br>
      I also love BZ and, although I know you're not responisble for the bulk
      of the game, I must say that the volcano's eruptions really add a degree
      of realism to one of the first FPS ever. No bullshit here.<br>
      <br>
      I also love reading your stories from the "field" on Brian Deuel's site
      from time to time <font color="ff0000">(Hi Rob! -B.)</font>. Very insightful
      and exactly why I love collecting. I'm more into knowing about my games
      than playing most of them! MH being the execption, naturally, as it's my
      most recent acquisition.<br>
      <br>
      OK. I'm rambling. Too much egg nog (read: beer and wine) or something.
      Anyhow, I was wondering if I might get an autograph of some sort to hang
      above my Major Havoc on my game room wall? I'd truly appreciate it and
      would gladly PayPal (or snail mail) some compenstation for postage, materials,
      time, etc.<br>
      <br>
      My deepest gratitude and, if you're ever in the Boston area, I'd be honored
      to take you out for a couple beers (or dinner, etc., if you're not a drinker).
      Stories of the "old days" never fail to fascinate me.<br>
      <br>
      Kindest regards and Happy Holidays<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Hi Rob,<br>
      <br>
      Let me see what I can figure out and get something your way. I would love
      to see a photo (if you can take an electronic shot) of your game room and
      your Major Havoc. I thank you for the great note, it please me that you
      are able to re-live that time when you first saw the game. It had a strong
      following, but because it was vector, and the operators had been having
      trouble with vector, it did not do as well as it could have. Too bad really,
      I still play my game and still love it too (thanks to Mark Cerney and his
      last 4 waves that I STILL cannot get through!) I am happy you found one,
      they are difficult at best to locate.<br>
      <br>
      As for payment for the autograph, have you been to my web site (which Brian
      maintains for me) recently (see www.orubin.com)? If you go there, I ask
      people who want to �thank me� to send a donation to a charity that is very
      close to my heart. <br>
      <br>
      You see, I am the Chairman of the Board of the Alameda County Community
      Food Bank (located in Oakland, California) and we feed about 120,000 or
      more hungry people every month. As you can imagine, with the economy what
      it is, there are MANY more hungry people than we can possible feed. And
      you can donate something via their website. All I ask is that you put my
      name in the �in honor of� field so that I know that you have made the donation,
      as the food bank staff will tell me.<br>
      <br>
      So, even though I have been unemployed for 20 months myself and would love
      a few extra dollars, I made a deal with myself long ago that I would never
      charge fans who took the time to write me about my games. And I am sticking
      to that.<br>
      <br>
      So, if you will do that for me, I will make a color photo copy of either
      the sales sheet or the front of the repair manual for you (which ever I
      can find easiest), sign it across the front (please tell me what you want
      me to say) and send it off to you as soon as I get the chance. Will that
      work? I have your address (which I sniped off this copy so it will not
      show on the web site if we post this message), so look for it soon.<br>
      <br>
      When you get it, have a look at my site (www.orubin.com) and click on the
      Food Bank Logo. It will take you directly to the food banks web site and
      you can make a donation from there. ANY amount is a help, even if only
      $5, and I thank you in advance for it.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for writing, and Happy Holidays.<br>

      <br>
      Joh: Hy Mister Owen Orubin,<br>
      <br>
      i was wondering if the beautifull videolaser game called Firefox based
      on Clint Eastwood's action thriller "Firefox" from 1982 is still available,
      'cos I've searched about nearly everywhere on the internet for how to buy
      that videogame.<br>
      <br>
      The only thing I once stumbled upon was the videocabinet that was made
      a year after the movie it's release in 1982, in 1983, the actual coin-up
      machine. if you please could tell me where and how to still buy this wonderful
      videogame, and how it could be available, to emulator programs, or if I
      have to pay for such an emulator, if you could tell me where and how I
      can still get this videogame, because I cannot believe that this videogame
      is pratically not to be found anymore, I look forward to receiving your
      answer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I have no idea. Of course they are not for sale in retail, so
      you would have to find one the way you are doing it, on the web. And this
      late in the game, I suspect there are very few left. That is all I know.
      Sorry I can not help you more, but I will have your letter put on my site.
      If someone has a Firefox for sale, please contact Joh Lee.<br>
      <br>
      As for emulators, there is a thing called LaserMame, but you would have
      to find the game to get the ROM images and the Laser Disk image. Other
      than that, again, I am of no help.<br>
      <br>
      Sorry, best of luck!<br>

      From Mark (mentor66@btinternetXXXXXXXXXXX.com):<br>
      <br>
      Mark: Thanks for passing my message on it is very good of you. <font color="ff0000">(To
      whom? -B.)</font> Can you please tell me how you did the [shot] routines
      in your games? I am finding it a very interesting area to work in.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I'll give you the quick details on Space Duel's logic of shooting
      saucers...<br>
      <br>
      In Space Duel, the computer ships, known as saucers, needed to shoot at
      the player ships or remaining objects on the screen to move the play along.
      However, you do not want to make them too good too fast.<br>
      <br>
      So, I would have each ship pick a target based on some game logic, which
      was a random WEIGHTED choice. Early in the game, the saucers picked objects
      as targets about 90% of the time. As game TIME went on, the objects picked
      the players more and more until it was 90/10 the other way after about
      5 minutes of play. And, each object was weighted to pick on one player
      or the other more often, so a green object had more chance to pick on a
      green player, but not always. Objects of other colors were simply a red
      or green object disguised with a different picture, but the logic was the
      same.<br>
      <br>
      To "aim" at the target, I would calculate a target vector using the shooter's
      speed and vector, and the targets speed and vector and distance. I would
      then calculate an ideal target vector and speed, that, if used as calculated,
      and neither object changes direction or speed, would score a direct hit.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, you did not want to score a direct hit every time, or the game
      would seem unfair. So, based on how long the game had been playing, a random
      element was added to the vector angle (plus or minus some angle) and a
      random variance was added to the speed (plus or minus velocity) which would
      make the targeting "not so good". The deltas were random within a range
      of values whose delta got smaller over time, so a shot COULD be very accurate,
      or way off, it was a random delta. However, if the player altered their
      vector or speed after the shot was calculated, they could avoid the shot,
      or they could alter in such a way as to steer into the random element.<br>
      <br>
      As the game time increased, the amount of variance possible was made smaller
      and smaller, thus making the shots more accurate. It looked as if the ships
      got smarter and better over time, and required to the players to keep moving
      and changing their position to keep from dieing.<br>
      <br>
      The rate of shooting also increased with time, as did the appearance of
      the saucers. If you left two or less objects on the screen for a period
      of time (whose length became smaller as game time increased as well), the
      saucers were ALWAYS launched as soon as possible. This also made the game
      harder over time as more saucers would be launched as the game got harder.<br>
      <br>
      An interesting bug came from all this: If a saucer was targeting a player
      and that player died (hit by an object or another player's shot), the saucer
      was supposed to immediately target the other player. However, a small bug
      kept this from working correctly all the time. A dead player, when ready
      to be reset on the filed, would be set at a random position on the screen
      and marked invisible. The game logic would wait until the player could
      be safely reappeared on the screen, another check to make sure there were
      no objects within some set distance before activating the player. The same
      logic told any saucers targeting that ship to leave the screen, meaning
      that when they reached an edge, they would not be restarted for some period
      of time. However, it is possible to collide with a saucer with shields
      on and cause the saucer to stop moving, or go very slowly on the screen.
      When the player it was targeting was randomly set to a new screen position
      to reappear, the saucer would star shooting at that spot as if it were
      trying to shoot the player, which of course was not there yet really. The
      safe entry detection did not check for shots, as they were not supposed
      to be any, as the saucer was SUPPOSED to leave the screen. A reappearing
      ship in this case would be shot at immediately. This did not happen very
      often, but to compensate for any possible errors in any collisions or shots,
      and give the player a reasonable chance, all reappearing ships are invulnerable
      for a few seconds as they "blink" in, giving the player time to move and
      shield before the ship could be hit again.<br>
      <br>
      In one mode of the game a set of saucers would appear together (called
      a mine sweeper) and they would juggle shots back and forth very fast between
      them trying to clear the field of objects. Each "pass" across the screen
      they would separate a bit farther and continue to shoot at each other.
      Their shots would not kill each other (just absorbed) but would kill players
      and objects on the screen. These shots used the exact same targeting method
      except their track was altered to ALWAYS hit the other saucer exactly,
      so there was not variance. If you shot one of the saucers though, the very
      fast shots aimed at it from the other saucer did not hit anything, so they
      just kept going very fast. A dangerous thing to do because the shots could
      easily hit you.<br>
      <br>
      Hope this helps you.<br>

      From Alexander Santos (misiewicz@xl.wpXXXXXXX.pl)<br>
      <br>
      I want to send out to you a very warm hello and a special thank you for
      giving my friends and I some of the greatest moments of our lives. The
      80's and Atari was such a wonderful thing. As a kid I dreamed of working
      at Atari developing awesome games. I have to tell you that it is a real
      opportunity for me to be able to send out an email to someone who was part
      of what was a very magical time for me. I was mesmerized at the graphics
      and sound coming out of those cabinets. Actually a friend of mine bought
      a space duel at an auction in Toronto, it was 200 dollars and worked beautifully,
      this must have been around 1986 or thereabouts. In fact vector games were
      one of my favorites due to their high res and unique graphics. The games
      you were involved in are definite favorites of mine.<br>
      <br>
      Alas, it is so sad that Atari went supernova. It was a spectacular company,
      especially the arcade division. I am impressed by the calibre of people
      involved at Atari, they seemed like a wonderful bunch from the arcade hall.
      When I frequented video arcades with a friend of mine, we would speak to
      the technicians there, in particular one fellow there, and he was really
      into the Atari hardware, he said it was the most well designed stuff he
      would see. You guys did a great job. Thanks for the memories!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Thanks for the message, and I appreciate the great words. We had
      a great time making them too, but it is very cool to see people still enjoying
      games this long after their creation.<br>
      <br>
      Tell you friend to go to my web site and read the new story about on the
      main page about the ZVG, a new vector generator that connects to a PC and
      the monitor in a Space Duel. By using this cool device, he can download
      VectorMame, and play all 32 or so original vector graphics games on the
      real vector generator game.<br>
      <br>
      At the show I went to, the took an old Space Duel game, added a roller
      controller (like on Tempest) to the cabinet control panel, and hooked the
      monitor up to a PC, the button up through another device to the PC, and
      you could play all these great vector games on the Space Duel. It looked
      and felt JUST like the real games...no, in fact, it looked better.<br>
      <br>
      Have him look at the my story on the main page (scroll down to it) and
      it lists links and such to all the companies that make this possible. For
      about $300 in parts, his existing PC, and a Space Duel game (which seems
      to work the best) he can have multiple vector games. (and no, I do not
      get paid to sell these things, I just think they are VERY cool addition
      to Mame.<br>
      <br>
      As for Atari, I agree, Williams, who owned the last of Atari Games, is
      obviously not paying attention to the market. Retro games are big again,
      and what a GREAT (rolling eyes) time to dump all the product and blow up
      the original. Just dumb in my opinion.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks again for the message. Feel free to write or ask questions any time.
      I try and answer as soon as I can, depending on my travel and work commitments.<br>

      </b> ALexander: Does this mean that Atari Games is really really gone?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen:Well, the Atari in the US we knew is gone. But some might argue
      that it was gone long ago. But the last of the Atari employees that were
      holding on to their fun jobs at what was left of the old Atari in Milpitas
      in gone.<br>

      games and he really likes them, thought I would let you know.<br>

      <b>Owen: I love this. Its why I think Mame is so cool.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Tell me something Owen, did you ever get a chance to meet Nolan Bushnel?
      He must be pretty sad about all that has happened to his company, it must
      have been hard for him to swallow huh? Personally I am in a kind of denial.
      What about yourself? Is it sad for you too?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Well, the game industry has been sad for a long time for me. The
      first game machine I bought in a long time was a Nintendo 64, of which
      I obtained about 10 games. I was not impressed with most of the games.
      And Nintendo not supporting the older games in their newer machine made
      me not want to buy one again.<br>
      <br>
      As for meeting Nolan, I was (am?) a friend of his, and use to spend time
      at his house in Woodside when he lived there. I also worked for a number
      of his start-ups (although never really paid to do so) when he created
      then. He is now in southern California so now I do not see him at all except
      at an occasional trade show.<br>
      <br>
      As for his being sad, it was not obvious to me. In fact, I think he is
      thrilled to see what he started (with others of course) build into such
      a HUGE industry actually. I worked with him at Bally Sente again after
      leaving Atari and he just wanted to create cool games. I do not believe
      he had any anger or frustration with Atari. He is a move on kind of person,
      and has moved on.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: What sort of projects are you involved in right now? Do
      you own or use macs at all?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I am unemployed right now, going on 16 months of not being able
      to find technical management work in California. I own MANY Macintosh computers,
      as I worked for Apple for almost 7 years! So, if you know of people looking
      for engineering or business development management, my resume is on my
      website.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: A few more questions. I am sorry to be bothering you, I
      hope I am not.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Shoot.....<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: When I visited your site, of course I went through most
      of it and did see the link to ZVG, I thought it was fascinating that they
      are people so into this, and man is it ever cool. But I didn't see any
      mention of the card working on Macs. Will it? Does it?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: No, it runs on DOS only on a PC. But any PC with about 700 Mhz
      PIII or above, something you can get for $250 OR LESS on the net will work
      fine. You do not need Windows, so you can get a DOS PC cheap to do this
      and never deal with (much of) Microsoft.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: I am considering a G5 purchase and would love one of these
      cards. But to use it I would need a vector machine right? Or would a vector
      monitor suffice? Does Wells Gardner still make these kind of monitors?
      Are vector monitors completely different from raster ones?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Follow the link on my page to their website. You only need a vector
      monitor, and almost ANY vector monitor will do. And of course you could
      use a keyboard instead of buttons, that works fine too.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: Gee whiz so many questions. It's not everyday I get to
      email a legend like yourself, it's true! Let me tell you something. I want
      to tell you about my experience with Major Havoc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: (rolling eyes) OK, enough of THAT!<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: First of all the game was completely unusual for me. It
      was so different, it had that beautiful modern cabinet design like irobot
      and firefox, all I tried, especially irobot, but I loved the 'track ball'
      controller your game had, how it illuminated! Wow, that was amazing,<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: OK, the cabinet was original done for Major Havoc, but my game
      was delayed so I, Robot came out in it first, so everyone calls it the
      I, Robot cabinet. But it was the Major Havoc cabinet that I, Robot used.
      I also did not want a ball, so the industrial design people created me
      a 2 dimensional ball, the roller. My game has a different color roller,
      a blue one as that was the original color as well, but the light did not
      show through it well, thus we tried yellow and green. I did not like the
      green, so blue it was. The engineer who designed the hardware gave me control
      over the light, so I could flash it.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: It was a little hard to play.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Well, it took a bit of practice to get good at, but I never felt
      it was particularly difficult. In fact, I went to great pains to make the
      game easy at the start.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: I loved the so smooth scrolling text describing the characters
      in the game and the story of this strange world major havoc found himself
      in.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Vector games allowed an item to be moved smoothly, so text is
      just another object.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: It was awsome how the point of view would switch, bring
      the player close up to the ship and then away to the landing sequence,
      fantastic. It was so different, so unique,<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I had a lot of fun with that. From an over shoulder view to a
      full third person, it took some time to get the transitions right. I liked
      to too.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: and very beautiful, bright, great side panel art, clean
      design. Man, you guys were totally ahead of the competition. One time I
      went to the Major Havoc Game a guy was racking up a huge score and on the
      weirdest of levels, he was a pro, he moved so smoothly through the game.
      That was game playing!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: There are 16 levels, and the last four repeat with a few changes
      in colors. Each level is harder and requires more tricks and skills than
      the previous, and what you learned in a previous you needed to get better
      and better at each successive level. I though it was well balanced.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: I remember, this was in Toronto, I now live in Poland just
      under a year and lived in Portugal for three years, and back then, around
      84 or 85, things were changing in the arcades, and not for the better,
      the problem was definitely a crisis in the creativity area.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I don't know if it was a crisis. I think the focus went to mind
      blowing special graphics effects (not to say we did not do that earlier,
      like the sparkling vectors in Major Havoc), but the main focus seemed to
      be trying to outdo the previous game with better and better graphics. I
      think the focus on game play got lost in the graphics.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: There were many games from Japan most of them shooters
      and fighters, over and over again. The Atari Games were not often played,
      I think Atari may have felt this trickle down to HQ as the numbers were
      not adding up anymore in terms of sales as arcade operators noticed that
      Ataris were not revenue winners anymore.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Personally, if I saw another side scrolling jump punch kick game
      I think I was going to scream. But they earned money. It took Atari a long
      time to figure out they needed one, and their first one that I remembered,
      that Dinosaur game was good, but not as much fun for most people. Atari
      had this "no attacking people" in their games, and all the Mortal Kombat
      games were gory and violent. I guess that sells, but I sure was not into
      them at all.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: Before I expected and played constantly changing games
      now it seemed to be the same thing over and over in a new package. Personally
      I was losing not interest but enthusiasm by all of it. I kept visiting
      the arcades to play my old favorites, of course the old Ataris and so on,
      I was hoping Atari would come out with another great game. This must have
      been around ohh 87? Not sure now.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I was gone by then, but Atari did come out with some great games:
      Paperboy, Gauntlet, 720, Hard Drivin, Stun Runner to name just a few.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: I must admit though, I don't play much anymore. Although
      MacMame of course, Unreal was great and is I think, because the arena is
      huge and multiplayer but still it can get repetitive in a way. I wonder
      what your thoughts or your peers thoughts are on gaming today. It's too
      bad but out here in Poland it is pretty dry, I don't know of one arcade
      here.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I started playing again on Unreal, which I love (although no longer
      play because all the people I played against are now elsewhere) and I also
      liked Marathon, a similar game. BUT, I do not play much anymore either.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: Well Owen, I hope I didn't bombard you with too many questions.
      I appreciate your time and thoughts, and thanks for reading this.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: My pleasure.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Alexander: I would actually enjoy writing about some of these things,
      are there sites that want writers?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Google is a great place to start looking! I have no other ideas
      for that on you.<font color="ff0000">(WEBMASTER NOTE: put together your

      Hi<br>
      <br>
      My name is Gerardo from Puerto Rico. First... my english isnot the best...
      he he! Well Im a Atari collector. I have a little collection of game (
      2- 2600, 1 2600jr, 1 5200, 1- 7800, 1 Linx and 1 pong and many games) I
      only need de Jaguar.<br>
      <br>
      I love Atari, I remember my young days... how I loved play. The other day
      I bought a 2600 for $3.00 in a fleamarket and its worked perfect.<br>
      <br>
      Surfing the internet today I found your page... then I decided to write
      you this e-mail to say Thanks for those great days that me and my brothers
      had playing in the 2600 and the others great games. I say thanks to you
      because I dont know other person or internet site like yours and you are
      part of the Atari Team.<br>
      <br>
      Well... I dont know if a express fine my self... I hope you understand
      that I want to say.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Thank you for your message. I do understand you and I thank you
      for your words. I am sorry to say that I made coin operated arcade games,
      and not the games that went into the home. Some of my games did get converted
      to the 2600, but I did not make the conversions.<br>
      <br>
      I like that you found a 2600 for $3.00. That is amazing.<br>

      <br>
      An exchange between Owen and matthew@mundomateoXXXXX.com:<br>
      <br>
      Matthew: It would seem that the modern approach is to redraw the entire
      display for every frame, but back in 1983 I can't imagine this was being
      done? For modern 3D games I understand this is necessary, but for a 2D
      game it seems like a waste of CPU power. It makes me mad that some 2D (and
      even 3D) games of today require 1GHz+ CPUs, massive hard drives, 64MB RAM,
      3D-graphics cards, etc., and can't match games in the 80's that only had
      1MHz to 8MHz CPUs, 90K of code, and 6K of RAM!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Well, all the vector games of yesterday actually did just that,
      they redrew the entire frame each and every time. The display memory was
      broken into two parts, the one being drawn by the vector hardware display
      engine (a state machine that drew to the display.) If you did not restart
      the display when it was done drawing, it would go black! So, why the display
      was drawing from one half the memory, the main CPU was calculating and
      placing instructions into the other half of the memory. You had to do this
      as close to the time it took to draw the screen as possible. Occasionally,
      the calculations would take longer than the drawing, so a loop was put
      into the display to redraw the same frame again, and this can be seen in
      a slowdown of the drawing speed on some of my vector games, especially
      Space Duel when lots of objects are on the screen.<br>
      <br>
      I agree with you, I am amazed that some modern 2D games need such powerful
      processors, and often ask myself why? But keep in mind that we built dedicated
      hardware to help us make the games what they were, and the hardware helped
      us a lot. In addition, our resolutions were much lower, typically 640x480
      in my days (for raster games) and our bit depth was smaller (8 bits at
      best) compared to some of today's true color display depths at 1400x1200
      or higher. Today, there is a LOT more data to move, so that takes some
      time as well.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Matthew: So, the assembly programmer and minimalist in me wants to
      know how the> display was managed on the mid-80's games, both on the hardware
      and software side. On my TI, there was just not enough time to redraw the
      whole screen as well as do all the game logic, so you only moved what changed.
      The TI had 8x8 characters that you could define the shape of, and then
      display in any of the 24x32 screen locations. The TI had hardware sprites
      as well, but only 1 color each. When I look at some of the older games,
      I'm floored at how much movement is going on, and that collisions don't
      miss (generally), so there must be some secrets to making all this happen
      on a 1MHz CPU with 90K of ROM and 6K of RAM...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Ok, on our raster games, we had both a playfield, usually either
      a set of 8x8 or 16x16 "stamps" that could be drawn to a background, or
      a memory mapped display to create the background. We also had something
      called motion objects (which varied in size based on the game, called sprites
      by some) which were, typically a memory mapped object that was "placed" over
      the background by the hardware. That means this object could easily be
      moved around the background by simply changing two registers that specified
      its X and Y position on the screen. So a few short instructions could easily
      move an object around the screen. In today's PCs, to move a "motion object" the
      computer has to write the object into the bit map display, then erase it,
      replace the background, and draw the object at its new location. A lot
      more instructions for just moving an object. In addition, the image in
      the motion object could be changed by simply putting a new value into a
      register that specified the next picture to draw. Early games had graphics
      in ROMs, and the motion object hardware would draw the proper picture from
      the ROM based on this register. This means no moving data to change the
      object picture as well.<br>
      <br>
      Think about this. To make a person run across a complex screen: We would
      draw and store a series of pictures of a person running into ROM. Then
      we could raw the background once! Now, to make the person run, simply place
      the motion object of the man running at the left edge of the screen and
      select picture one from the ROM, a few simple instructions. When it "runs",
      you simply update the position of the object (a few memory stores) and
      change the picture to the next in the series, a few more instructions.<br>
      <br>
      Compare this to a modern PC: Again, create the pictures of the running
      person and put them in memory. Then draw the background on the screen.
      Now you draw the person on the screen. To move the person, you have to
      erase the old drawing by replacing the person with the background, then
      redraw the person with the next picture in the series at the next location.<br>
      <br>
      OK, I have simplified this a lot. Obviously, you can streamline the move
      on a PC by only drawing pixels that actually change, but in a complex motion
      object, this could be a lot of pixels. And with a lot of objects, this
      gets processor intensive.<br>
      <br>
      Later games had RAM instead of ROM for motion objects, so the object itself
      could be altered.<br>
      <br>
      Collisions were ALL software. We tried hardware that told us when two motion
      objects touched each other, but it was not very useful for so many reasons.
      We spent a lot of time on doing collisions well. That is a whole different
      discussion.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Matthew:<br>
      <br>
      Display: As for the display, I understand completely what you described
      about the motion objects, but what about color depth of them? Were you
      limited to 1 or 2 colors for the motion objects? Was there a limit to how
      many you could have or how big they could be? Was the video processor reading
      completely from ROM to produce the dislay? It amazes me that a ROM (back
      then) could be read fast enough to provide bitmap data to the video hardware
      for drawing the display.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: It of course depended on the hardware. Some hardware had small
      and large depth motion objects. Some, for shots for example, might be 2
      bits deep. Player objects, large in size, might be 4 to 8 bits deep. Rarely
      did we have any deeper than while I was there.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Matthew: I wonder why modern graphics systems have done away with
      support for motion objects? I suppose the speed and power they have makes
      a blit operation more efficient. But my biggest gripe is that it is sloppy
      software that pushes us to require faster hardware.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Strangely enough they would have little use except for game machines.
      Although the cursor could be done that way. I wondered why myself there
      is not better support. EXCEPT, what would be the right amount, size, depth,
      etc. of motion objects? If you had 4 of them, why not 8? Would it really
      make modern game programming better? Some games have 100's of moving objects.
      A good bit-blitter is probably better. I would rather see multiple graphics
      layers instead of motion objects. That way, you would not have to redraw
      the background, only the object. A lot less drawing.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Matthew: Also, I'm curious about how scrolling playfields were done.
      One of the early (early for me) games I loved in the arcade was Xevious.
      I tried and tried to reproduce that game on my TI, of course it just didn't
      have the hardware to do it. But even today I don't know how you would go
      about such motion with the hardware limitations you were working with then.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Much simpler than you think. The actual memory map is bigger than
      the screen, and a set of "scroll registers" say where in that map to start
      drawing. Change the pointers, you scroll. The program simply has to draw
      into the map outside the visible area to keep the map full. This was not
      that different from X-Y games and how they scrolled. Make sense?<br>
      <br>
      </b> Matthew:<br>
      <br>
      Collision: When you do collisions, do you perform a bounding box check,
      or exact pixels, or a combination of both (bounding box to get close, then
      pixel check for exact collision)?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: You do a rough check in X and Y to see if you are close. If you
      care, you can do a more elaborate check based on the size and shape of
      the object. In Major Havoc, I checked the feet, knees, waist, chest and
      head of a single drawing as if they were separate objects. Made for collisions
      that did different things depending on where they were hit.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Matthew:<br>
      <br>
      Game Loop: Did you have a game loop?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Yes, something like that. Although the switches and controls were
      usually read during something called the Vblank interval. A non maskable
      interrupt was generated each frame at the start of the time when the beam
      stops drawing on the bottom and returns to the top. This is the black bar
      you see when you make a TV roll. This was also used to sync the game with
      the display. Sounds were done here too, so they always sounded the same
      regardless of how busy the game got.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Matthew: This is what I see in modern examples, but I cannot find
      anyplace that talks about the "game loop", how it came to be, or alternative
      ways of doing things. Of course each of the "display" functions above would
      blit the given images to the background, whereas the old game software
      would not have to do this since the video hardware takes care of drawing?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Well, there are still problems. Some older games you might notice
      the motion objects "split" during the drawing. You wanted to move all the
      objects during the vblank interval. But there was a lot to do in only 16
      ms, so sometimes the interval routine would run long, and the update would
      not take place until into the active video. If you moved a motion object
      close to the top of the screen, you would see part of the object at place
      one, and then the other part shifted because the software would update
      its position while it was being drawn.<br>
      <br>
      Be aware that we had some games that were much like today's PC. Missile
      Command was like that for example... A large bit map.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Matthew: I suppose I should dig into MAME's source to see how the
      hardware was used. I've also been thinking about writing a game on an older
      game machine just to see what it was like for you back then. What hardware/software
      did you typically have to develop with?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Our computer genius Dave Shepperd modified DEC's PDP-11 macro
      language for us to use with 6502 and 6800 processors. We wrote in assembler
      for the most part until the mid 80's, but I left by then.<br>

      Thanks for your time.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Game play wise, there is no difference at all. The board has the
      final ROMs in it. We (Atari) bought the game completed, and just needed
      to make localization changes for the US market. I do not recall any programming
      changes at all. The graphics are hand made on parts of the cabinet...paper
      cut outs in some places. If I get a chance, I will take a few more photos
      and put them up there.<br>

      Q: Don?t want to consume a lot of your time, but I just wanted to introduce
      myself and say ?Hi!?.� My name is Thomas Rahbar and I live in Edmond, Oklahoma.� I
      grew up during the heyday of arcade games and always enjoyed going to the
      local arcade.� Atari has always had a significance in my life.� My first
      computer was an Atari 800, and I kind of went from there.� I am now a system
      analyst/network engineer and I feel like it is because of the influence
      of my childhood.� Anyway, I just wanted to take a moment and thank you
      for the creativity you and your team had on the games you worked on/created
      in the 80?s - creativity which has been lost in my opinion today.� In fact,
      I now own 25 or so arcade games in my home.� One of them which is a Major
      Havoc that I proudly display in my game room as the centerpiece.� I still
      play it every day or so and it is my prized possession.� I recently acquired
      a Battlezone for my boss and just got the XY working.� Nice volcanoes!
      ;)<br>
      <br>
      I just thought it would be great to have an email from one of the ?great
      ones? of the day.� And to say that I truly appreciate everything you have
      done for the staple of my childhood and so many others. �I think it is
      really great that you have a website where fans can leave you email and
      that you take the time to respond to them.�<br>

      Another question from the Webmaster:<br>
      <br>
      Q: Heard of this one (description is second game down): <a href="http://www.arcadeflyers.com/?page=flyerdb&subpage=flyer&id=3510&image=1" target="_blank">http://www.arcadeflyers.com/?page=flyerdb&subpage=flyer&id=3510&image=1</a> <b>(NOTE:

      <br>
      <b>Owen: YES!<br>
      <br>
      In the last 70?s early 80?s there were bar wall games making the rounds.
      Basically there was a wireless controller with 1 button (typically, this
      may have had three) and two controllers, one for each player if multiplayer,
      which this was. On the wall was a rather large game (rather flat, but maybe
      5 to 6 feet wide and 3 to 4 feet tall, �with a series of graphics on plex
      with lights behind each graphics, so that if you sequenced the lights correctly,
      an animation of a sort will show up. These wall games included horse shoes,
      duck hunting, and Atari did one called UFO.<br>
      <br>
      The UFO would ?streak? across the sky on one of several paths. You pressed
      the button to shoot at the UFO, and a shot would come up from the bottom.
      If your shot sequence hit the UFO (basically, the lamps would light at
      the same time) the UFO would sequence to a crash.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, the game required you to press the button to start the animation,
      and then after some time, let it go, or press it again to release. I do
      not recall the exact game play for UFO. In horseshoes for example, pressing
      the button started the throwers arm moving. You presses again to release.
      The closer to the exact release timing, the closer the horse show would
      get to the pin. The UFO game played much in the same way.<br>
      <br>
      Somewhere in the back of my sick mind, I recall doing some software for
      this machine, but I may be wrong. �But it was NOT my game by any means.
      I wish I could remember more.<br>

      A three-way exchange between Owen, Curt Vendel (from <a href="" target=_blank>atarimuseum.com</a>)
      and <a href="http://www.spies.com/~albaugh" target="_blank">Mike Albaugh</a>,
      another former Atari engineer.<br>
      <br>
      Curt: I have some notes from Steve Calfee on a Gremlines coin-op, but I
      heard rumor long ago of a possible ET coin-op being considered. Did this
      actual make it to a prototype or test unit? You guys know who would've
      been assigned to this project?<br>
      <br>
      <b><font color="ff0000">Mike: I'm CC'ing Owen in case he remembers more,
      but I am probably closer to this subject.<br>
      <br>
"E.T." was one of three games proposed for the hardware that was used for "Return
of the Jedi". The third was Ed Logg's version of Road Runner. Only Jedi was produced,
but as I recall E.T. got to the prototype, maybe focus-group stage. The programmer
was Robin Ziegler. The game-play was simply to guide E.T. through a number of
scenes, avoiding the "scientists" and picking up parts of the "phone" to phone-home.
Gary Stempler would have been the engineer, as he was the designer of this hardware.
I do not recall who the animator or composer were.<br>
      <BR>
      As a side-note, Robin also (because of this?) worked on Atari's last pinball,
      also E.T.-themed originally, but when the (negative) marketting ramifications
      of the E.T. name (combined with large royalties) caused the abandonment
      of that name, the game was re-done as "4x4", with the backglass featuring
      a recognizable Milt Loper and Carol (Branham) Vedell. This was also never
      produced. Robin had a protoype, with 4x4 playfield, until I bought it,
      but time and money pressures led me to "pass it on". If I grub back through
      my email I _might_ be able to find the name of the guy who bought it.<BR>

      <br>
      Although I realize that's not what you asked for. I'm just amazed at what
      one can find...<br>
      <br>
      </font> Owen: There is not much more I can add to that, that is how I recall
      it as well. I do remember the forest scene where ET had to drop and then
      pick up small candy bits.<br>
      <br>
      I also remember Steven Spielberg coming into Atari to see the game and
      others. I was working on Major Havoc at the time, he had a quick look and
      then later said to me that he wanted to see it again. I said he would have
      no problem finding it. I ran to the vending machine and bought a bag of
      Reese's Pieces and led a trail from where he was to my game down the hall.
      He showed up a bit later with a handful of the candy, which he dumped into
      the trash, asked if there were any left (seems he liked them as well) and
      then played Havoc. He liked the game I recall, but at the time I only had
      3 levels and he made it through all three!<br>
      <br>
      Mike, you did forget that I also did the golf simulator on the same hardware,
      and it did not ship either.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="ff0000">Mike: I do remember the Golf Sim., but did not recall
      that it used the same hardware. Do you happen to recall whether the Laser-based
      Road Runner came before or after the one on this hardware? I know both
      came before the System-I version by Norm and Greg.<br>
      <br>
      I _really_ gotta start setting aside time for making entries into a "Atari,
      as I remember it" article. Like, what was the name of the operator who
      was neither Cynthia nor Linda? Before Linda of the dubious mushrooms who
      married Dave Wiebenson.<br>
      <br>
      </font> Owen: I had the laser based system the same time as Ed [Logg- Asteroids,
      Gauntlet] had it for Road Runner. We shared code and development a bit.
      I continued with the Laser based system after he stopped because I had
      to have it, he, according to the people who "knew", did not! So, I assume
      it was the same hardware. Maybe Jed did some modifications to it thought
      for the sensor inputs.<br>
      <br>
      The Laser version was first if I understand your question.<br>
      <br>
      Argh. I remember that operator. Short, blonde. I can picture her well,
      but damn if I remember her name.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="ff0000">Mike: I thought it preceded the one he did on the
      ET/Jedi hdw. That hardware was very different, and not at all what I intended
      to say. "Jedi" (and the other two) had a scrolling playfield with "pixel
      interpolation", an "Alphanumeric" overlay, and System-I-ish Motion-objects,
      but a 6502 rather than a 68K (It preceded System-I). The point of the Pixel-interpolation
      was to be able to afford a lot of playfield graphics without paying for
      a lot of ROM. It used 1/2 the resolution of the other two video elements,
      and "averaged" the surrounding pixels to fill in the pixels that were not
      stored. I quoted "averaged" because of course it did nothing of the sort,
      being table-driven rather than algorithmic. This hardware also had "fully
      decoded" Color-ram, so each unique combination of alpha, playfield, and
      motion-object video could be a distinct color. This was used to "matte" the
      foreground/background (done in alphanum) against playfield and M.O., and
      to provide effects like E.T.'s flashlight.<br>
      <br>
      </font> Owen: Hmm. I believe the one I had was 6502. I may be the one confused.<br>
      <br>
      As for the details, I do not recall. All I know was I used the same hardware
      that Ed used for the Road Runner laser disk game. You know more about the
      details than I.<br>

      out to all Classic Gaming Expo alumnus and speakers):<br>
      <br>
      Q: Dear Classic Gaming Alumni,<br>
      <br>
      Digital Press would like to know "the most memorable moment of your classic
      gaming career"!<br>
      <br>
      Recently we asked everyone to let us know what one special moment from
      the classic gaming days stands out the most from all others. We received
      a bunch of responses but we're still in need of about 25 of these memories.
      Some people had one incident which they fondly remembered while others
      had 2 or 3. All we ask is that you take a few minutes to write a few sentences
      to tell us all about it, if you haven't already done so.<br>
      <br>
      This could be anything at all (a software or hardware breakthrough or achievement,
      an award you won, a party you attended, a party you shouldn't have attended,
      etc.)<br>
      <br>
      Don't delay! Here's your chance to be immortalized in the annals of Digital
      Press. Help keep our senior editor from killing me for going past the deadline
      with this feature. Unfortunately I need these as soon as possible, so any
      help would be greatly appreciated.<br>
      <br>
      My thanks in advance and looking forward to seeing many of you in Vegas
      again this year.<br>
      <br>
      Best wishes and many thanks,<br>

      <b>Owen: This is hard to answer, as there were many great moments. But
      here are 2 I still recall fondly to this day:<br>
      <br>
      My most memorable moment was the very first time I got to see people play
      one of my games on a field test. I created the code for Cannon Ball (my
      first game) completely by hand (which is another long story available on
      my web site) and it was put out for testing at a local arcade to see how
      it would collect. I decided to sneak out to the arcade and watch people
      play. It was not a perfect game (which is why it was there) and we were
      not allowed to tell people who we were, but when I saw players laughing,
      joking, and having a good time while playing the game, I knew it was going
      to be a great job!<br>
      <br>
      Second most memorable time: I worked in a secondary building behind the
      main Atari building on Division Street in Los Gatos at the time (1976.)
      In our area our team was developing 8 player Tank, one of the first games
      to use a microprocessor actually. During lunch, a large group of executives
      would come into the lab to "play" the game. Well, not really play, but
      watch, and this was why: The game did not have computer controlled players
      when any paid player was playing because management believed that people
      might walk up and think they were playing a tank when actually the computer
      was, and then not put in any money. If ANY player put in a coin, ALL other
      tanks stopped in their home parking place waiting for a coin. However,
      when no one was playing, the tanks were all controlled by a somewhat random
      computer algorithm in an attract mode, where they attacked each other.
      The tanks would keep playing for 3 minutes or so, and scores would actually
      tally on the screen. Now why management did not believe that people walking
      up to the game during attract would not think they were playing was beyond
      me, but I digress. ANYWAY, the executives would place best on the tanks
      to see which would "win" attract play. Lots of money would be dropped down
      on the glass top with each executive betting on of the 8 colored tanks. �Lots
      of yelling would take place as the cheered on their tanks. After one such
      betting session, one of the executives stayed behind, just sitting at the
      game and watching the tanks. I walked up, sat down and we started to chat.
      I had no idea who this was, and I gladly answered all sorts of questions,
      including ones about what I liked about Atari, and also what I did not
      think worked. We talked for about 35 to 40 minutes about both the good
      and bad at Atari. He thanked me for the chart, shook my hand and walked
      out.<br>
      <br>
      My boss then walked up to me and said "Nice having you work here Owen..
      Good luck in your next job!" I asked him what that meant, and he told me
      I was, as he put it, complaining to Nolan Bushnell! Well, I was in a panic
      for a short while, because I did answer his questions on both the good
      AND bad. Was I going to be fired for that? Well, as it turns out, Nolan
      came back the next day, found me in my office, properly introduced himself, �and
      thanked me for my candor with him the day before. He told me that he appreciated
      that I was "just myself" with him and did not try so hard to impress him.
      He told me that I was welcome to find him and chat about Atari, or anything
      else I wished anytime. And I did, and I considered myself one of his friends
      for quite some time after that. Lucky for me I did not know who he was
      at the time. I was also invited to place my bets with the executive team
      during lunch, but I was not that crazy. :-)<br>

      <br>
      An exchange with Marcel (MGONZAL3@CRDUS.JNJNOSPAM.COM):<br>
      <BR>
      Q:Owen,<br>
      <br>
      First of all, I send you a nice firm handshake on all the Atari projects
      you have made in the past. I am very fond of the Atari Vectors you created.
      I am doing a bit of research in order to create a really nice 80s laserdisc-game
      related website. I was wondering if you were involved in the Atari Firefox
      project in anyway.<br>
      <br>
      Big thanks!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I was not directly related to the Firefox project, but did lend
      some "input" if you will.<br>
      <br>
      First, I was Atari's so-called laser disk "expert", having been sent by
      Atari to MIT for graduate sessions in laser disk technology. I originally
      suggested that Atari NOT do the game because of technical limitations of
      the hardware. My conclusion was that the hardware would not hold up to
      arcade abuse, AND, that the technology was not fast enough to do a reasonably
      good game. I knew it would have problems. After all, they sent me to MIT
      to learn what I could and help make decisions. They decided to build the
      game anyway.<br>
      <br>
      My other "contribution" was just before its public display at a trade show.
      Many of the Atari engineers had gone to AMOA, a trade show on amusement
      machines being held in New Orleans. I opted not to go, I believe I was
      still working on Major Havoc at the time, and was just too tired to do
      a trade show because I had been working so hard on my project.<br>
      <Br>
      Well, they had Clint Eastwood planned to attend the show and were going
      to present the game with Clint Eastwood showing it off. They had a huge
      stage in the booth. So the day of the show, they plug in Firefox and it
      does not work. They plug in the second board and it does not work. The
      show opened with Clint Eastwood standing in front of a big red curtain
      with a Firefox coming soon sign. They were in a panic.<br>
      <br>
      So I get this frantic call right after the show opens. Please go to the
      lab of the team that was creating it, and see if I can make it work. They
      were going to send back Nolan Bushnell's Lear Jet to San Jose with a stand-by
      crew, so that when we got it working, they would wisk us off to New Orleans.
      So a couple of engineers and I go to the Firefox lab and boot up the development
      system. We load the program and it works. But it seems that when put into
      EPROM, problems occurred. Long story short, after about 14 hours of work
      (after already working many hours on my own game) we fixed several problems,
      burned several sets of EPROMS, and grabbed another board (tested it!) and
      headed for the airport to fly us off to New Orleans. We get there about
      the time of the opening of the second day of the show, someone meets us
      to rush us off to the show and they get the game running. The actual timing
      of this is not clear in my head anymore; this may have actually been the
      third day- I am not sure. I do recall that I was so exhausted by that time,
      that I did not attend the show, but rather opted to sleep on the plane
      as it was going back later that same day, and I did not have a hotel room
      anyway.<br>
      <br>
      But it was fun!, in a strange sort of way.<br>
      <br>
      I should add a few more pieces of info.<br>
      <br>
      Atari started several other laser disc games that never saw the light of
      day. I was starting Battle Star Galactica and Knight Rider as possible
      laser disk games (testing), Road Runner was originally a laser disk game
      with real cartoon clips and laser backgrounds. VERY cool. I also did a
      golf simulator where you hit a real ball with your own clubs at a big screen
      (there was a net in front of the screen) and we projected a ball over a
      laser disk image from the gold course. We then offered fly over views of
      the course (never implemented as we never shot the scenes for the test),
      golf lessons (we had a good number of pros do lessons, including some humors
      ones) and other laser disk video.<br>
      <br>
      Galactica was a fighter and land game using the laser disk to show progress.
      We shot a test landing sequence using only laser disk footage where you
      had to land on the Galactica. You could spin 360 degrees and had to land
      flat. Never got far. We also looked at tons of footage from Knight Rider,
      and there was some great footage of KITT landing that the audience never
      saw. Seems in the early shows they actually jumped a real car. They had
      cameras all over the place, including in and on the car. Except when the
      car hit, it was usually nose down, and the front was usually crumpled beyond
      recognition. They had many cars, one for just Michael driving, one for
      parked close ups, one for when it drove itself (the drive was inside the
      driver seat looking through the head rest, a cheap effect if you look closely)
      and MANY cars for jumping. So, in the game, if you missed a jump, we had
      lots of footage for crumpled landings. This game was killed before we did
      anything because of problems with laser disk games.<br>
      <br>
      I have some of the test footage on a laser disk from golf and Galactica.
      I was also a Cube Quest fan, and I believe I still have a laser disk from
      Cube Quest as well.<br>
      <br>
      </b> Marcel: This is really great information. Let me tell you what I have
      been doing:<br>
      <br>
      Star Rider and Firefox were most frequently played by myself in my teens.
      I managed to spend all my Publix bagboy allowance on them for about 2 weeks
      until they started to experience technical problems with the laserdisc
      games, including these two. So last year, I bought a badly broken down
      Star Rider upright. Broken player, monitor, and missing boards! Thankfully
      the cabinet was in good shape and the laserdisc had not rotted. I gave
      it 8 months of my life to bring it back to life. Being overly impressed
      with the system and the CG work, I started trying to gather as much information
      on the Star Rider. It seems that very little people actually care about
      the game, so I did not have any luck at first. Slow but surely, I started
      to find and meet folks. I met up with several people who worked at Computer
      Creations, Inc. in South Bend, Indiana. They were the ones that used all
      the ultra-expensive equipment to make the CG. Extremely nice people. I
      met up with most of the members of the Star Rider project team who worked
      at Williams. I spoke to Python Anghelo, who was the man behind the game
      and art concept.<br>
      <br>
      What I got from the people at Computer Creations was ecstatic! They took
      great pride in their work, commenting that "they had never achieved a scale
      of CG before". The Star Rider CG footage had actually won an award and
      it appeared in SIGGRAPH. I got some very informative stuff.. the hardware
      they used, the amount of grueling time they spent on solving problems,
      the VAX units they had to buy for the production work, etc. Amazing stuff.
      People I spoke to: Herman Towles, Ken Lantz, and 2 other gentlemen I can't
      think of their names right now.<br>
      <br>
      What I got from the people at Williams was also informative, but rather
      dissapointing. Everyone I talked to was very hesitant to talk to me about
      the project. Pretty much at first they all asked me "Why do you want to
      know about this" very harshly, but after I told them my reasons they agreed
      to spend some time on the computer with me. What I found out is that almost
      the ENTIRE Williams R&D and operations personnel was DISMISSED from work
      because of the outcome this one game had! Not very good news came out from
      these peoples' mouths! I did get in-depth information from an ex-electrical
      engineer about the DISCAN system; the boards; the capabilities of the PR-8210
      player, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The only Williams guy that gave me a true-to-the-fact story was Mr. Anghelo.
      He told me of all the things that Star Rider could have been, and all the
      things that the company totally screwed up on. Star Rider was supposed
      to have a similiar track layering scheme as in Firefox, to include player
      options. Star Rider was supposed to use the rear-view-mirror effect for
      throwing fireballs at opponents. There were other videodiscs planned for
      this 'revolutionary' (Williams DISCAN) system, one being an Afterburner-type
      3D shooter game, and another one being a Powerboat-race game.<br>
      <br>
      So anyways, I will get all this information and make a nice detailed site
      about it. If nobody cares about it, it won't bum me a bit. The game deserves
      praise for its art concept and all the blood and guts that went to it,
      at least to me.<br>
      <br>
      Again, thanks for your time!! I would love any more input you can give
      me. When Firefox was placed on test location, what were the results? Was
      it basically the Phillips player crapping out ?<br>
      <br>
      If and when I do create the site, I will include a 'Firefox' section...
      they were some really great games despite its technical faults!! <br>
