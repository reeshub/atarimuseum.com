<td width="60%" valign="top" bgcolor="#000000"><font color="#ffffff"> Many of
    you have said in one way or another "How can I thank you for making such
    great games?" Well, I have a way actually. I used to be on the Board of Directors
    for the Alameda County Community Food Bank, an agency that feeds over 800,000
    meals to hungry people every month, but they are only scratching the surface
    of the problem. And with the tight economy, more people losing their jobs
    every day, and many people donating to the other world disaster causes instead
    of local charities, they are receiving less money than expected and needing
    to feed more and more people every month.<br>
  <br>
  If you want to thank me, do so by making a tax deductible donation to this
  food bank. You can find their site at: <a href="http://www.accfb.org/donate.html">http://www.accfb.org/donate.html</a>.
  There is a link to an online secure page for donating via Visa, or you can
  send a check if this makes you nervous. I personally do not see any of this
  money, it all goes to a good cause to feed hungry people. Please, consider
  helping those less fortunate than us, and do let me know if you make a donation
  so I can personally thank you as well. (You can do this online by selecting
  the box that says "My donation is a tribute to someone special" and putting
  my name in there, or write "Requested by Owen Rubin" on your check. Again,
  it just tells the food bank that you are donating at my request so they can
  tell me you did that.) Thanks again for all your continued support for my old
  games, and in return for the donations, I will continue to personally answer
  email questions from any of you as quickly as possible as my way of saying
  thank you.<br>
