    <td width="50%" valign="top">&quot;It's easy to get isolated and become a
      hermit with computers,&quot; a young games programmer named Dave had told
      me the night before. We were in his den, with starfields exploding on the
      screen of his desk-top Atari 800, and the world ending in a shower of nuclear
      warheads on the upright Missile Command module in the corner, its computer
      patiently playing against itself in the absence of a human opponent. Now,
      the morning after, we are entering the hermitage.
      <p>The sun that once ripened apricots here is rising over California's &quot;Silicon
        Valley,&quot; an area south of San Francisco Bay where computer 'plants
        now thrive in industrial parks. Inside the engineering headquarters of
        Atari, the world's first manufacturer of coin-operated video games, Dave
        finds a computer printout waiting for him on his desk. His office space
        is a paneled cell, as fit for contemplation as the cells of medieval
        hermits, with a small chalk board on one wall. He studies the printout
        to see whether the corrections he requested have been added to his program,
        a still sketchy set of instructions for a new game he is working on.
        Then he has his first brainstorm of the morning, grabs pencil and paper
        and begins writing:</p>
      <p>&quot;Multi monster sequence. Every other wave: no friend. For each
        attack IF timer equals 4 THEN 'too slow,' exit monster mode. After monster
        is zapped, IF timer is 4 THEN reinitialize monster mode.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Is that programming language?&quot; I ask. &quot;Oh no,&quot; he
        says. &quot;It's plain English.&quot;</p>
      <p>I have a feeling that I've been zapped.</p>
      <i>
      <p>&quot;We're making technology transparent&quot;</p></i>
      <p>To most of us outside the computer culture, its initiates seem to live
        in a world so alien that they might as well be medieval hermits, or in
        some other time warp of their own. They appear in a popular campus poster
        as &quot;nerds,&quot; whose heads are the only thing about them not screwed
        on backwards. But Dave is hardly a nerd. If anything, he is still the
        mischievous kid with tousled blond hair who liked physics and chemistry
        in high school but didn't like the titration experiments. &quot;I liked
        to make the bombs and flares and stuff,&quot; he says. Only now he is
        making them into electronic fantasies, and is far happier than in the
        days when he worked for Bunker Ramo or National Semiconductor developing
        computerized check-out systems for supermarkets.</p>
      <p>He is working now at designing coin-operated video games, among people
        who see technology itself as a game. &quot;We're making technology essentially
        transparent,&quot; one Atarian says. &quot;We're making it friendly,&quot; says
        another. &quot;That has not been the point of view of the big business
        systems, or the military computer business, and it gives us an advantage
        in going into</td>
