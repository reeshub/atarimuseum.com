        or even simply by pointing at it with your finger and directing it to
        move an image from one part of the screen to another.</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It may be a while before you can wag your
          finger at a personal computer and get an intelligent response. But
          it seems certain that these machines will continue to surprise us.
          Dr. Robert E. Kahn, at the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects
          Agency, is convinced that we're going to see &quot;some very powerful
          and intelligent systems show up&quot; in the next few years. Kahn has
          watched the evolution of computers from a unique vantage point, at
          an agency which has funded many of the most important research projects
          in artificial intelligence, time sharing, computer graphics, computer
          networks and other major advances in computer technology.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In the next decade, we'll see a lot
          of what I call garage-shop computer engineering, and maybe even a little
          science,&quot; he says. &quot;It's getting to the point now where you
          can go to your local supermarket and if you can't buy a floppy disc
          now, then tomorrow you'll be able to, and for $19.95 you can get a
          bag of logic, and some powerful chips. I think we're going to see a
          world of innovation come out of young kids, high school kids and pre-teens
          of all kinds, who are just given access to technology, with creative
          minds and no constraints.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And talk about cultural effect&#151;I think
          people may be incredibly surprised at how clever some of these young
          people can be. While they may not have a good basic knowledge of the
          outside world, they will be dealing with an artificial technology where
          they can construct anything that they can imagine. And they've got
          great imaginations.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">After watching kids at MIT's Artificial
          Intelligence Lab, Seymour Papert has a similar view. &quot;I don't
          think there's anything wrong with arcade games,&quot; he says, &quot;except
          that you have to play that one. I think in terms of creating a computation
          environment in which you not only have access to unlimited numbers
          of games but where you can make them yourself. And then the word 'game'
          takes on a different meaning. I think what it is all about is getting
          into 'microworlds,' simulated environments which are exciting because
          you can manipulate them. I think we don't fully understand what makes
          that sort of manipulation so powerfully attractive.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Are the Atarians in their cells really
          the monks of these microworlds? Not long before he built the first
          Apple computer, while he still worked at Atari, Steve Jobs went to
          India. Having grown up in the Silicon</font></p>
