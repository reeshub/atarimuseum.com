    <td width="50%" valign="top"><font face="Times New Roman">Robinson led a
        small squad to the Silicon Valley to get the game converted, and bring
        it back. &quot;In the arcade version, it's sort of a space tank war with
        moving pylons and flying saucers,&quot; the major explains. &quot;We
        used the new Infantry Fighting Vehicle as the game.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Army's version has realistic silhouettes
          of both enemy and friendly tanks, helicopters and armored personnel
          carriers. Using realistic aiming coordinates, a player has to pick
          the right weapon for a target, select the right ammunition and rate
          of fire, estimate the range, and destroy the target before it gets
          him, in anywhere from ten to 25 seconds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;We've got the scoring algorithm designed
          to reward him for getting hits rapidly, and for destroying the most
          dangerous target first, and it subtracts points from his score if he
          fires at a friendly vehicle,&quot; Major Robinson says. &quot;When
          we demonstrated the game at an armor conference at Fort Knox this spring,
          one of the generals who saw it said we should have a fist come out
          and punch the guy in the head if he's stupid enough to fire at a friendly
          vehicle.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like arcade games. Army Battlezone gets
          more difficult as a player improves. &quot;That seems to be the psychology
          behind Atari,&quot; the Major muses. &quot;You never can win, and you
          always can get better.&quot; The Army has not yet tested the game,
          but has laid out a careful program of research in the field, to establish
          whether skills acquired playing the game can be transferred to military
          training. If they can, the Army already has its eyes on other games
          which might be modified to train air defense missile gunners and tank
          crews. &quot;I am not a programmer or design technician,&quot; Robinson
          says. &quot;I'm an armored cavalry officer and damned proud of it.
          But I've got a gut feeling that you can take these machines and put
          them in every company-sized unit in the army and get a lot of training
          value out of it.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman">At Williams Air Force Base near Phoenix,
          where psychologists have had a chance to study pilots trained in the
          multimillion-dollar computer simulator for the newest fighters in the
          Air Force inventory, the AIO and the FIG, arcade games are also viewed
          as potentially valuable.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. Thomas Longridge, at the Human Resources
          Laboratory on the base, is using an aircraft carrier landing game for
          research on pilot judgment. He sees the array of information that players
          of some arcade games cope with as requiring skills like the rapid information
          processing performed by fighter pilots with video displays in their
          cockpits. And he thinks the games, like simulators, may train people
          in a kind of &quot;multiplex,&quot; many-channeled thinking that Air
          Force psychologists would like to understand better. &quot;We're </font></td>

                part-task trainers,&quot; says Dr. Longridge, &quot;as an alternative
                to the multimillion-dollar monster full-mission simulators the
                Air Force is buying now, and the extent to which you can accomplish
                similar kinds of- training.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">The distinction between computer
                games and computer simulators is blurring here, and in many other
                places where small, inexpensive microcomputers are taking over
                tasks that required huge mainframe computers a few years ago.
                Home computers have more versatility than most people know what
                to do with. One Atari engineer calls them &quot;solutions in
                search of a problem.&quot; Already, however, they have begun
                to make the distinction between playing and learning a little
                hard to draw. An example of this is a home computer game that
                simulates the political economy of an ancient kingdom:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">You have a ten-year reign as the
                king and you have so much grain, so many people and so much land.
                You can 'buy or sell land for grain but you can't plant more
                acres than you have people to work at farming them. If you don't
                feed your people enough, they start to die. If they die, you
                can't plant as much grain anymore, and you may get into a downward
                spiral. But if you plant too much and store it, rats eat some
                of it, and</font></td>
