      <b>Classicgaming.com's "review" of Major Havoc</b>
    </center>
    <br>
    <br>
    The following text is in reference to the review of my game Major Havoc at
    Classicgaming.com (click <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060308081052/http://www.classicgaming.com/rotw/mhavoc.shtml" target="_blank">here</a> to
    read it).<br>
    <br>
    Ok, maybe I am biased because I designed the damn thing, but does Fragmaster
    have a clue? Some of the great games in arcade history were multiple game
    plays and did extremely well. One example of that? Major Havoc. How about
    Gorf and Astro Blaster to name a few others? These games did very well in
    arcades, and even today have a large followings of people who collect and
    still play these games.<br>
    <br>
    He seems to be reviewing this game based on today's games, and recall it
    was designed back on the early 80's. He obviously did not play very far into
    the game either, or simply has no patience for amusing titles. Oh, I'm sorry,
    Major Havoc does not have a gun, how could "fragmaster" ever enjoy it?<br>
    <br>
    First he complains that it has too many different things, then he complains
    that it does the same thing over and over. Which is it? Replay Magazine actually
    commented that the pace and learning curve of Major Havoc was one of the
    best they had ever seen. Something new arrives in each wave, and the game
    always gets harder. Yes, it has no ending, neither did Asteroids, Pac-Man,
    Space Invaders, Battle Zone, ...! Lets use his logic and style and review
    Missile Command:<br>
    <br>
"Some little lines show up on the screen. What are these? Are these supposed
to be missiles? At least that is what I believe they are. You roll around a cursor
on the screen and press a button. Another line starts from the bottom. What is
this? If the two lines meet, a large circle erupts and stops any other lines
that touch it. If one of the lines gets to the bottom, they destroy these little
stack of boxes that are supposed to represent cities. Lose all of your boxes,
you are done. That's it, the same thing over and over!"<br>
    <br>
    Wait, how about Asteroids in his style:<br>
    <br>
"What is that annoying sound? It gives me a headache. So there is this small
triangle thing in the center of the screen. What is this, a space ship? You can
rotate it, thrust it, fire something, and make the ship disappear. The instructions
says the ship goes into "hyperspace." Where is that? You move around and shoot
at these round things. I think they are supposed to be rocks, or maybe asteroids?
And what is this ship shooting? It is powerful enough to break apart the asteroids
into multiple smaller asteroids that look exactly the same. And there is no ending.
You just do this over and over again."<br>
    <br>
    I think you get my point. I could do the same for PacMan, Space Invaders,
    and Tempest? Time to put fragmaster out to field, this guy has no idea how
    to design a game, much less what makes a game good or not. How about someone
    who understand the games of the 80's reviewing games of the 80s? Not this
    wannabe "fragmaster." From his name is it obvious all he likes is first person
    shooter games. I have learned from experience that these people are only
    happy if they can blow the hell out of people or people like images with
    tons of guns. He would not know a good game if it shot him in the head! Which
    is not a bad idea.<br>
    <br>
    And just to be fair, I have done my load of turkey games. I put them to sleep
    before anyone ever saw them. Major Havoc was a great game (if I do say so
    myself) and one I am very proud of.<br>
