      Q: Owen,<br>
      Thanks for a great site! What a terrific resource for old arcade junkies
      like myself. The new design is great - very easy to read.<br>
      <br>
      Regarding Triple Hunt - MAME .61 is out now and has that driver in it.
      If someone can shoot decent photos of the artwork somewhere, I'm familiar
      enough with Aaron's new artwork handling system where I could set it up
      to work with MAME. Some examples of what I've already been working on are
      up on my page at: <a

      <br>
      I look forward to reading more great stories on your site!<br>
      <br>
      P.S. Thanks for the volcano! Battlezone is my all-time favorite, and I
      spent many a quarter trying to get to it. :)<br>

      From Angel Daly <br>
      <br>
      Q: Greeting,<br>
      i did a web search on petsters from Axlon inc and your web page came up,
      somehow atari and these pets are somehow related? Anyway i recieved a petster
      cat when iwas about 12, packed it up in a box when i moved back to my moms
      and there it sat for about 15 years in a box, until yesterday i thought
      i had lost it, but i took it out of the box and she still works perfectly,
      my kids and dog think this is the greatest thing ever ( mom is so cool
      right now) anyway i cant find any information on the company, i just 5
      minutes ago learned that there are more petsters out there, if you know
      nothing of this i apologize for wasting youtr time, but any info would
      be greatly apreciated, im just curious to learn more about this item and
      the company thank you very much<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: It is strange that it would find me, as I did behind the scenes
      work on the Petster, maybe because I mention it on my Kermit page. You
      will see on my web page (www.orubin.com) a link to Kermit, a robot I worked
      on while at Atari. This robot became Nolan Bushnell's model for a robot
      company called Androbot. He tried with Androbot, a company in Sunnyvale
      California in the mid eighties to build home robots. For obvious reasons,
      it was not all that successful as the robots did not do that much.<br>
      <br>
      Given that I had programmed Kermit to be more of a pet and less of a robot,
      something that just walked about, made noise, followed a few command when
      it felt like it, it really acted like a pet robot. Nolan obviously liked
      this idea and created Petsters from a company called Axalon, one of Nolan's
      many start-ups.<br>
      <br>
      I have a Petster cat sitting on my floor near my fish tank. Unfortunately,
      one of the most common failures of these toys was that the small gears
      break and the motors no longer drive the unit.<br>
      <br>
      The unit is controlled by clapping your hands. Two short claps, two times
      will put it in attention mode. ("clap clap, pause, clap clap") They eyes
      should blink very fast.<br>
      <br>
      One clap only will put the unit into "come when called mode"<br>
      Two claps will put it in "go away" mode<br>
      Three claps, pause, one clap will make it purr (when you make noise)<br>
      Three claps will put it into "obey" mode, where more claps move it (1 to
      4 claps)<br>
      Four claps puts it in random "go play" mode.<br>
      <br>
      They are quite fun, and drive the real cats nuts.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Q: Greetings. I am a huge retro fan and am also a creator, but my focus
      has always been on music more than coding... I am only wondering... How
      is it possible that someone of your talent is actually looking for a job/has
      a resume? I just don't get it man. Life has sure took a turn for the worse!
      High level languages leave low level coders in the dust, but what I wonder
      is what happens when the low level coder is completly eliminated? Since
      high level languages are coded in low level languages, will there come
      a time when people are so accustomed to the software they use that noone
      remembers anymore how to program it? If so, will this natural evolution
      be a good or a bad thing? I fear the same has happened with art. People
      have the ability to create wonderfull things now, but with no soul in them
      whatsoever. Where will things go? Understanding is becoming relinquished.
      Understanding is no longer required, so the understanding that the forerunners
      achieved is being deemed irrelevant, yet their devices are being used.
      ONce again, I wonder where it will all go... Oh well, enough babble!<br>

      Space Duel is one of my alltime favorites, I can recall the whole atmosphere
      of walking into an arcade back in the 80's and playing it, it was truely
      a beautifull time period!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Thanks for this message, made my day.<br>
      <br>
      Lets see, why am I looking now? OK, I was a low level bit twiddler, and
      then like everyone else in my days, I went to C and to 12 years ago I got
      moved to management and found I was very good at finding and growing good
      talent, and was considered by my teams (with a few ugly exceptions of course)
      a very good manager. So I kept growing into management, built some very
      successful teams, and now reached the VP level.<br>
      <br>
      With the economy as crummy as it is and so many people being laid off,
      I too was hit with a "down-sizing" as my last company ran low on funds.
      I guess I could go back to coding, but not sure I want to do that. I can
      find so many people who can do it much better than I, why bother. What
      I am good at is managing and helping teams grow and be successful, which
      I can do well. Add to that a good understanding of business, project life
      cycles, and engineering budgets and schedules, as well as a very strong
      technical background in software, hardware, networks, and broadband and
      I am strong executive candidate. Except that there is not a strong demand
      for executives at this time, so I am still looking. (any leads are welcomed.)<br>
      <br>
      As for low level coders, the new compilers are built with high level languages
      as well. Compilers compile themselves basically, so low level coders are
      less and less needed. And to be fair, trying to hand code at low level
      on today's processors is VERY difficult because of the extreme complexity
      of the data and instruction flows. I did some hand coding on the Power
      PC at Apple, and it was very hard. I finally wrote the same code in C and
      compiled it, and the compiler created faster, more compact code! *SIGH*<br>
      <br>
      In my view, if the processors are complex enough (didn't RISC stand for
      reduced instruction set computing?) then the compilers and higher level
      languages are needed more. A good compiler (VERY HARD TO FIND ONE THESE
      DAYS) will do a much better job than any had assembler these days. Yes,
      understanding of how it works is being abstracted away behind complex language
      structures and methods.<br>
      <br>
      I will have a look at your site and music, one of my favorite parts of
      a game is the sound and music, but I was not great at music unfortunately.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks so much for the message, and good luck with your music. And of course,
      if you know people looking for executives....... :-)<br>

      From Chip (chips@gearboxsoftwareNOSPAM.com)<br>
      <br>
      Hi Owen,<br>
      I recently came across your page and was very interested in your response
      to a letter about your laserdisc games. First of all, I'm a developer of
      modern games at Gearbox Software, but I spend most of my "free" time working
      on an emulator called Daphne. Daphne, as you may know, emulates laserdisc
      games.<br>
      <br>
      Daphne began as a project to emulate Dragon's Lair and Space Ace, but we've
      grown into much more than that. Presently, Daphne emulates 12 different
      laserdisc games, and we even have preliminary support for the "turd", as
      you called it :), Firefox.<br>
      <br>
      But what I'm mostly writing about is the prototype games you mentioned
      on your site, and whether or not you might be interested in these games
      seeing the light of day by running them in Daphne.<br>
      <br>
      If you've got any of the program code, we could emulate that. But, Daphne
      is capable of running a new game natively, so if the original program code
      is lost, we could still get, say, the golf game or the knight rider game
      up and running with all new game code if the footage were available. You
      mentioned you still have the discs for golf and KR. Daphne can either control
      a laserdisc player with an original disc, or it can run our "VLDP", or
      Virtual Laser Disc Player, which basically uses a combination of mpeg and
      ogg files to display the laserdisc footage.<br>
      <br>
      If something like this is of interest to you, all we'd need to get started
      is a capture of the LDs, and an idea from you of how the flow of the game
      was supposed to be.<br>
      <br>
      So, stop on by and check us out: http://www.daphne-emu.com, and let me
      know what you think. I, for one, would love to be able to play out those
      games you talked about, and daphne is a tool we can use to bring it to
      life. And with Daphne, the hardware issues of yore are no longer a concern.
      :)<br>
      <br>
      Lastly, I just quickly wanted to say thanks for your contributions to the
      industry. I spent more than I care to share on your games, and I wouldn't
      be in the biz now if it weren't for designers like you. Ok, enough butt
      kissin'...<br>
      <br>
      =)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I was not aware of Daphne, I will indeed go check it out. There
      are some cool Laser Disk games, and I loved Space Ace and especially Dragon's
      Lair. I spent a LOT of money on DL. We finally got one at Atari, and I
      played so much that I could finish the game in one play, and play most
      waves from a quick peek at the first direction, and then move by the sound
      alone!<br>
      <br>
      I have a laser disk with SOME of Golf's test shots, and I believe only
      the test footage of Battlestar Galactica's landing bays. I do not know
      what happened to Knight Rider's disk, I continue to look for it because
      it was very cool.<br>
      <br>
      I am just heading out of town for a week, but would like to contact you
      when I get back into town to talk about what I have. I do not, unfortunately,
      have any of the code, but creating some new code would be interesting.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for the message.<br>
      <br>
      And yes, I thought Firefox was a poor game as it was rushed into a game
      (or as far as it actually got) and never really thought out well at all.
      It could have been so much more. Sad really, Atari spent all that money
      sending me to MIT, and then ignored all my advise because it was not what
      they wanted to hear. Everyone else was doing laser disk games, they needed
      to do them too. The equipment of those days was just not meant to be bashed
      around like an arcade environment created, and as I said before, the players
      were just too slow.<br>

      mr. rubin,<br>
      my name is david steinhauer, im currently attending fullsail in orlando,
      florida. im about to graduate (still have 4 months), and will soon be lookin
      for a job (whenever i say that, i wanna laugh). ever since i was about
      4 years old (playing poker/blackjack on the intellivision) ive wanted nothing
      but design video games. my mother used to drive me around on sundays to
      different locations where they had arcade games... my favorites, major
      havoc, wizard of wor, and discs of tron (enviornmental). i clearly remember
      jamming over $10 worth of quarters into the major havoc (in one day) at
      the "diamond jems" in montgomery, alabama. now that im on my own, ive started
      collecting what i consider the best games of all time... i have a wizard
      of wor upright, warlords cocktail, and a stern super cobra (not one of
      the best, ive never been a fan of it, haha). one day (when i win the lottery)
      ill get my very own major havoc (the day my life is 3/4 complete). i just
      wanted to tell you that you unknowingly gave me the drive and inspiration
      to fill my dreams. i "show and tell" as many people as i can about early
      coin-op vector games and what they have to offer; people are amazed and
      they ALL want MORE. its a shame that the coolest game of all cant be controlled
      as intended on a pc... one of these days i can show them how its done (on
      an upright). what you created in the early 80s will never die... i or anyone,
      can frag 10,000 quake duds and not remember what happened the last hour
      i played, but i can still remember the first time i found the MH escape
      shuttle (and the last time, for that matter). i only hope that one day
      i can offer the world what you have accomplished... making some of the
      best games EVER made...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Thanks for the very nice letter. I appreciate your message and
      I am glad, that indirectly at least, those of us who created these early
      games helped drive you in your education. Good luck in your search for
      a job. Remember, you first job may not be your ideal job. After graduating,
      there is still much to learn, and professional growth is just beginning.
      All I can say is have patience, work hard, and you will get what you want.
      Do tell me when you have your first game out, I would like to see it!<br>

      Hello Mr. Owen Ruben,<br>
      My name is David Pollitt and I just saw your home page. My home page is:
      www.ncf.ca/~es230<br>
      <br>
      When I was in High School I played Space Duel a lot and in my opinion it
      is the greatest action video game of all time! I loved it and I bacame
      quite a good player as I remember. It is becasue of experiences like this
      that I went into Computer Science at Carleton University here in Ottawas
      Canada. I just want you to know that you are a hero of mine and I very
      much respect you and your work on the design of Space Duel.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Thanks for your message. Some of the credit for Space Duel has
      to go to Steve Calfee, my manager and the project manager for the game,
      and Ric Mauer (spelling?) (NOTE FROM BRIAN: It MIGHT be Rick Mahler; not
      sure if Rick Maurer of 2600 Space Invaders fame was the programmer) started
      the game before leaving Atari. I used much of his code, and Steve was a
      driving force behind the game and getting it done. While I added a lot
      to that game, it was a group effort, as are most games today.<br>
      <br>
      Good luck in your schooling. Maybe when you get out, you can build a game
      I will play! :-)<br>

      From: Paul D.<br>
      <br>
      Hello Mr. Rubin,<br>
      First of all, I would like to thank yo for putting up your website and
      sharing your insights to enthusiast like myself.<br>
      <br>
      You mentioned in one of your email correspondence (in the site) about having
      to design something similar to a Golf Simulator in LD. I have a home/self
      project and currently looking for sensors that would work on golf application
      in particular, one that would work with Microsoft's Links 2001 Golf Software-
      that I may fit real golf balls with my own clubs.<br>
      <br>
      I was wondering if you could refer me to such a manufacturer or distributor
      of sensors for this application.<br>
      <br>
      Thank you in advance for your kind assistance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Well, that was 30 years ago, so it may be hard to find. There
      was a small device, about the size of a can of tennis balls, made by I
      think, Panasonic, which had an LCD display. The device came with a mat
      of green "grass like substance" with a bunch of magnetic sensors in it.
      It had a tee you could remove for tee shots and grass shots. It could read
      any steel club swinging past, and came with small magnetic strips to put
      on "woods" (which, in that time frame of the late 70's and early 80's WERE
      WOOD!) which let the device read drivers.<br>
      <br>
      We bought a bunch of these for our prototype game, took them apart and
      built an interface into the LCD to that my computer could read the information
      that this thing displayed.<br>
      <br>
      On the device, you would select which club you were using, and hit a real
      ball into a driving range net. The device would read the speed of the club,
      the height of the club, and the open and closed face angle, then display
      the distance the ball should have gone, if you hooked or sliced, and how
      badly, and how far off track the ball actually went. We added additional
      sensors of our own, basically weight monitors, to monitor the weight shift
      of the person (you can search the web for "strain monitors" I believe)
      and also added a number of microphones. With the mics, we could pick up
      the exact time the ball was hit, and then the time AND location of there
      the ball hit out "screen", which game me additional information on the
      speed, height and direction of the ball.<br>
      <br>
      Sorry, but that’s the best I can do here for what we did. There are some
      gadgets that you might consider buying then adding a small PIC processor
      to interrupt the output to something that MS Golf could use.<br>
      <br>
      Obviously, someone did what we planned to do, have a look here. The first
      3 are almost exactly what we were doing at Atari in 1984!<br>

      You know, your link to your website and all your stories on there that
      I just read, really brought back some memories from my youth. I was 11
      years old when you were programming for Atari Owen, and I may say that
      you had my dream job in that magical era. I can only imagine what it must
      have been like to be at Atari during those classic years that started a
      revolution. I've dabbled in programming since I was about 9 years old,
      but I never really made a career out of it, although I currently work closely
      with computers and their related technologies. Thanks for the line, and

      We were at work, talking about jobs of yesteryear and I mentioned that
      I had been electronic tech for several amusement machine operators and
      manager of a couple of arcades. I managed a Gold Mine arcade back in the
      early eighties and they had a Major Havoc. Undoubtably one of my favorite
      games. Never could find one, but I do have a Tempest that's in pretty good
      shape. Love those X-Y Quadrascan monitor games (if you could keep the driver
      transistors from blowing). I remember a Black Widow too, but it never made
      it big. I only saw one. Anyway, one of the guys did a search and came up
      with your site. Pretty cool. I'm trying to get the emulation to work so
      I can enjoy a little nostalgia.<br>

      Thanks! <br>
