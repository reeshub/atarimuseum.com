      Hello Owen, Chip would like me to send you a VHS tape to stir your memory
      regarding the Atari Preliminary Test disc. Please send me your mailing
      address and I will have a tape sent out to you. (You don't need to worry
      about returning it or paying for tape and shipping fees-this is my pleasure
      to do this for Chip as well as the rest of the laser game community) To
      avoid any confusion, below are the emails that Chip and I have exchanged
      regarding this issue (as well as your response to Chip).<br>
      <br>
      Regards,<br>
      Brendon Zeidler<br>
      <br>
      <b>NOTE: I left out Owen's reply to this message as it didn't contain anything
      but contact info.</b><br>
      <br>
      Owen,<br>
      The VHS tape went out yesterday via priority mail. It's taped in SP mode.
      Remember that the original laser disc had intermitent sound. There are
      certain segments that have no sound at all. (I didn't want you to think
      I did a crappy job recording it) :-)<br>
      <br>
      Let me know if it stirs up your memory or if the stuff on it is, in fact,
      your early work. I am interested to find out. Hey BTW, would you happen
      to know of anyone in the Bay Area that has a really nice (cosmetic), completely
      working Fire Fox? (I figured you were the guy to ask considering it is
      the ONLY Atari laser game ever made)<BR>

      <b>Owen: The video tape of the video disk arrived in today's mail believe
      it or not.<br>
      <br>
      I am watching it now. I forgot ALL about Playland video, our first idea
      for a video game. I will type my comments as I watch this....<br>
      <br>
      That is a REAL model of an amusement park that was built by the way, and
      a motion control like camera moved across the model for the shots. There
      are some graphics used, those places are obvious. Someone actually did
      program up the game with the spinning disc. Shows how clueless they were
      at the time, as to do this right, you would only need to record ONE spin
      of the disc and have the player loop it over and over. The original game
      had additional point items with graphics objects superimposed over the
      disc.<br>
      <br>
      If you touched a toy on the disc, you died. Given the graphics capability
      of those days, it would have been VERY difficult to have rendered the 3D
      objects on the moving disc anyway.<br>
      <br>
      I believe this disc was done by the "Advanced Research Department" which
      rarely talked to the game engineering people. There are a lot of wrong
      assumptions on game play.<br>
      <br>
      The Race Course: We wanted to do a real driving game, and I recall someone
      on the same team I was on doing this at Sears Point in California near
      Napa. Doug Phol kind of did what he wanted. Even though I was supposed
      to be in charge of VD games, he took a team out and started shooting all
      this stuff (I mean crap!) without talking to anyone. Can you imagine trying
      to make a game out of that footage? I do not know what they were thinking.
      I do remember him getting laid off finally. :-)<br>
      <br>
      OH MY GOD!!!!! Thats me running up the stairs walking around the building
      opening doors, etc. I guess I did have something to do with this disc!
      :-) We were doing a treasure hunt adventure game demo. It was very silly,
      but were were trying to show off the video disc hardware. This was shot
      in the Atari Engineering Building I believe at 1501 Mc Carthy in Milpitas.
      I had no idea this footage was on the disc. Can you imagine trying to make
      a game out of this? :-) I think my lab was down that long hall they keep
      showing.<br>
      <br>
      As for Firefox, I actually did not make that game, I just did some work
      on it to help the team out. I worked on the Golf Simulator (never shipped
      or completed) and a Battlestar Galactica game (never got off the ground)
      and a preliminary test for Knight Rider, and LOTs of preliminary VD work,
      but nothing that was shipped. As for who has one, no, sorry, I have no
      idea.<br>

      Q: Howyadoin Mr. Rubin?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for taking the time to read this and thanks for your site. I feel
      old asking you this but I'm sure you remember lunar lander right? I've
      been searching for some info on it, hopefully I can find it somewhere for
      p.c. It's a long shot, I realize but it's been on my mind and I'd like
      to relive my past.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks to guys like you, I'd skip many a day from school and risk getting
      caught just to play my favorite games at the corner store! No hard feelings
      at all, I wish my children had video games as their only temptations nowadays!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Well, if you feel old asking about it, how do you think that makes
      me feel since I was there at Atari when it was created?<br>
      <br>
      Yes, I know the game well, and in fact, I remember the game on PDP-11 computers
      way before it hit the arcades, so that makes me even that much older. :-)<br>
      <br>
      The best way to play this is to get a copy of MAME and find the ROMs by
      searching the web (I have seen them on Hotline servers from time to time)
      and then you can play it at home all you like.<br>

      Q: Hello Owen<br>
      <br>
      I really enjoyed reading through your page. Is there any noticable difference
      in the prototype DigDug you own in comparison to the final released product
      (artwork, cabinet, graphics/gameplay, etc.)? Also, when a game was completed
      that you worked on at Atari, were you offered to keep a copy of the machine,
      or did they make you purchase one if you wanted one?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks in advance!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Hi Steven.<br>
      <br>
      Very good questions.<br>
      <br>
      There are no differences as far as I can tell in my Dig Dug prototype and
      to the arcade final except for my paper graphics.<br>
      <br>
      There were usually several prototypes for any given arcade machine we designed.
      After the project was over, they were usually offered for sale for a cheap
      price, and the project team got fist call. If there were not enough, we
      would hold a drawing to see who got to buy them. Some were given away,
      but I do not recall which ones.<br>
      <br>
      If no one wanted them from the project, then there was a drawing for the
      units from everyone in the company.<br>

      <b>The following message was partially lost, but offers excellent insight
      into how early black & white and color video game video hardware worked.</b><br>
      <br>
      Q: Thanks for the reply and the info. I think my real issue is what you
      mentioned about how you took the digital signal and made it look like an
      analog video signal. I'll keep going over schematics to try and get this
      figured out. And, if you hear from your engineer friend, any insight of
      book list suggestions would be a big help.<br>
      <br>
      BTW, great website.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Ok, here is his answer (From Howie Delman). He designed many of
      the early game Hardware systems. Hope this helps you. Recall, we are NOT
      outputting RF, but raw video signals in our designs. That means simple
      counters to count vertical and horizontal lines, memory buffers to hold
      a line that is clocked out one at a time, and an output section as defined
      below:<br>
      <br>
      -------------<br>
      <br>
      <font color="ff0000">Howie Delman: ... but it is not difficult to explain.
      On the oldest black and white games, there was no conversion because the "colors" were
      only black or white. Video was one bit deep, and the output of a logic
      gate went directly to the monitor through a buffer transistor (emitter
      follower).<br>
      <br>
      When we added "light grey" and "dark grey", we used a two bit "DAC" made
      with resistors. The outputs of two logic gates were tied together through
      resistors in an approximate ratio of 2 to 1. Other resistors adjusted the
      dc level. Even the early color games used resistors, because the bit depth
      was small. The Sente SAC-I, for example, had four bits of color for red,
      green, and blue. I used resistors in an R2R configuration to create a four
      bit DAC for each color.<br>
      <br>
      In all cases, a transistor was used on the output to buffer the resistors,
      and to lower the output impedance for the monitor. Eventually, when video
      depth reached 6 and 8 bits, monolithic video DACs were used.<br>

      From: Joe Magiera (joemagiera@ameritechDOTnet):<br>
      <br>
      Q: Hi Owen,<br>
      <br>
      I had the pleasure of hearing you and your other Atari buddies talk about
      the old times (early 80's) at Atari during the video game hey-day.<b>(NOTE:
      Joe is referring to California Extreme 2002)</b> It was very enjoyable
      to listen to all the stories. Wish it went longer.<br>
      <br>
      I had been a pinball and video game addict, but never played Major Havoc
      when it was in the arcades. In fact I don't ever remember seeing one. I
      didn't get to play it until I started collecting a few years ago. Now I
      can honestly say it's definitely one of my all time favorites. I have it
      in a Gravitar conversion, and someday, someway, I'll get a dedicated.<br>
      <br>
      One story from the CA Extreme panel discussion that caught my interest
      was you mentioning your desk by the dumpster, and your adeptness at dumpster
      diving and saving many items that would have otherwise been lost forever.
      I had hoped to ask you about this at CA Extreme, but many people wanted
      to talk to you there. I was hoping to see you later at the show, but must
      have missed you if you did come back. Before I ask the question though,
      need to provide a little background.<br>
      <br>
      My favorite game of all time is Missile Command. I heard about a sequel,
      Missile Command 2. This is NOT the same Missile Command 2 that was featured
      in the game "Atari Arcade Classics" which was at CA Extreme, but a separate
      effort done much earlier, around the time of Missile Command. I did a lot
      of research and posted to RGVAC a long story about it.<br>
      <br>
      If you want to take the time to read it, you can view the story it at:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://www.joesarcade.com/joem" target="_blank">http://www.joesarcade.com/joem</a>,
      from there click on Missile_Command_2.doc.<br>
      <br>
      Since I posted the story, I found more info about it. I had guessed that
      David Theurer wrote the sequel, but in fact it was Rich Adam. I spoke briefly
      to Rich about the game; he politely but firmly made it clear he didn't
      have the rom data/images for the game. His only guess was maybe that Norm
      Avalier might have them. I tried contacting Norm with no luck.<br>
      <br>
      I've read your web site completely to be sure I didn't ask you something
      that's already been asked. I noted where you mentioned in one place that
      you actually sat right next to Rich Adam, and that you also had hard copies
      of many games.<br>
      <br>
      Now for the big question, in any of your dumpster diving, might you ever
      have come across any ROM data or program listings for Missile Command 2?
      I came across a couple of prototype boards for Missile Command 2, but alas,
      sadly, ROM-less. Any ideas/leads where I might be able to track any more
      info down on this? I'd really like to hear if the control panels were the
      same or not as Missle Command (Rich told me it played in a stand up cocktail
      like game, like Atari Football).<br>
      <Br>
      You can see a couple pictures of one of my prototype Missile Command II
      boards at:<br>

      <br>
      It was the typical classic Atari design, single board, the size of a Major
      Havoc board. By the way, that is not my web site, but another collector,
      also named Joe that lets me borrow space on his server.<br>
      <br>
      I'd sure like to try to revive this game. Hope you have some leads. Even
      if I could just get a listing, I'd be willing to type the whole game in
      again.<br>
      <br>
      FYI, I also have some pictures of this year's CA Extreme posted at the
      same web site mentioned above. Since it's borrowed space, I can only keep
      those pictures up for a couple of more weeks though.<br>
      <br>
      Hope you had a great Christmas and have a great New Years. Thanks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Such a great long message, thanks. But I have a very short answer.
      Yes, I shared a LAB with Rich Adam, but that was not the same as my office.
      I also worked with Rich at Bally Sente as well. But to be honest, I do
      not recall this game at all. How strange is that.<br>
      <br>
      And, unfortunately, I have very little of my old Atari coin-op stuff left
      any more other than a bunch of T-Shirts. I had a bunch of stuff when I
      moved originally, but it has mostly disappeared (we lost stuff in our move
      and I suspect it was all lost then. But I did not have this game in any
      case. Sorry.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for the question. I hope you find some more info.<br>

      <br>
      A question from the Webmaster to Owen:<br>
      <br>
      Q: I was reading a very old issue of Next Generation magazine (issue 7,
      July 1995). Within was an interview with Sam Tramiel, during the Jaguar
      years, and in it he says, "There's an old coinop from the old Atari games
      called Major Havoc. It was a Tempest game from a technology point of view,
      with vector graphics. The game featured Major Havoc who goes out and saves
      a space station. He's a very cool character. We're going to modernize him
      and make him into an Atari character, bring him back from the '80s."<br>
      <br>
      Know anything about this?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Oh yes, I know all about this. When Atari split in the 80's, any
      game ideas before that time were owned by the Tramiel's to create consumer
      versions. Part of the settlement split. Here is the story as best as I
      can recall.<br>
      <br>
      After they did Tempest, they wanted to do Major Havoc. I met the Tramiel's
      on an airplane on the way to January '95 CES, and met with them again at
      CES. They asked me if I was willing to work with their lead designer to
      remake Major Havoc into a Jaguar game. I agreed.<br>
      <br>
      The sad part, was they had no intention of paying me, they just wanted
      me to sit with their guys and consult on game play and design. After a
      bit of talking, they agreed to hire me as a contractor, but it was obvious
      that getting paid would be difficult, as the balked on money over and over.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, and also because of what had happened with the Tramiel's and
      the company that made the Atari Lynx (recall, they sued the company and
      refused to pay for the product, put the company that made it out of business,
      and got the unit basically for free) I asked for 75% of my fee up front.
      The Tramiel's had a reputation in the industry of not paying for what they
      agreed, always claiming some kind of contract dispute and refusing to pay.
      I assumed they would also dispute my contract later, so I wanted my money
      up front. Obviously, they said no. I would do it no other way.<br>
      <br>
      They also did not have a Major Havoc game, did not have the original listings
      or code, and needed both my game and listings to make this work. They really
      thought that Major Havoc could become an Atari "mascot", but they were
      not willing to pay to get it done. The project died shortly after this
      discussion. Oh well........<br>

      Q: Dear owen<br>
      <br>
      For starters, I would like to thank you for all the hard work that went
      in to seeding that videogame industry. I love to think about all that went
      on in the Good ole days. I have heard about The movie "Outstanding in out
      feild" a humorous look at what happened at Atari. I have read that you
      were in the film, and I have yet to find a copy of it. I was wondering
      if you had any insight on where I could find a copy. Any info would be
      great.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: I received this same question from two people on the same day
      about the origin of the video, "Outstanding In Their Field".<br>
      <br>
      Yes, I am aware of this video. Not only am I in it, but I was one of the
      people who created it, filmed it, and edited it. The title is "A Day At
      Atari" and I showed it to people who attended a video game conference called
      California Extreme where I was asked to be a speaker.<br>
      <br>
      As for getting a copy, I am sorry, but this video is not now being distributed
      by anyone. I own the original copy, and if and when I can get permission
      from all of those who were in it or helped make it, I may post it to my
      website or sell copies. But until then, sorry, it will just have to wait
      until I get invited to another game conference.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for your interest.<br>

      Q: hi Owen- it's Peter Freeman- we spoke during last CAX and emailed a
      bit since. Hope you're good.<br>
      <br>
      Quick question, since you're the world authority on such things:<br>
      <br>
      On level 13 in MH, there's a boxed-in timer in blue on the right, requiring
      a key that never shows up. What's the deal? Is there some hidden way to
      access this, and what does it do? I seem to remember seeing similar clocks
      on other levels, no clue about them.<br>
      <br>
      still play my Havoc all the time...<br>
      brilliant design through and through.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Owen: Its a great question.<br>
      <br>
      Strangely enough, the code is still in the ROM, but we decided what it
      did only made the game longer. When that wave was originally written, getting
      in was MUCH easier than getting out. The Out path had WAY too many fireballs
      and robots.<br>
      <br>
      If you found the key to that wall, you could open it and touch the clock.
      It slowed EVERYTHING in the game down considerably. Everything including
      the timers, but NOT Major Havoc. It made getting out much easier. But we
      were not sure we liked it, the level reviews said it did not work, so it
      was easier to simply remove the key from the level and reduce the number
      of objects.<br>
      <br>
      There is a collision bug that occasionally lets you get through a wall.
      You have to reverse roller directions AND your velocity EXACTLY on the
      frame you hit the wall. The computer thinks you came from the other direction
      and passed through the wall, and will ?transport? you to the other side.
      It is very difficult to do, but I did see someone get to the clock this
      way once. Otherwise, they were never put into full use. We just did not
      remove them.<br>
