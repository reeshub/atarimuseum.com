  during the "golden age" of arcade gaming, and worked on such hits as Space Duel 
  and Battlezone. He is probably best known for the games he created that WEREN'T 
  produced, and for his cult classic, Major Havoc. Read on!<br>

<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">What raster games did you work 
  on before stepping into the world of vector games?</font><font color="ff0000"> 
  </font></p>
<font color="ff0000"><p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">LOTS! Many never saw the light 
  of day however. I think in all my years designing I probably did 20 or more. 
  I don't remember them all.</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font size="2" face="lucida sans unicode" color="#000000">BEFORE vector, I did (all coin-op, 
  some made it to the Atari 2600) Cannonball, Skydiver, Triple Hunt (all 3 produced), 
  I worked on Pool Shark, did a game called PT Commander (2 boats fighting each 
  other). I did a game called Orbit which was a rip off of SpaceWars vector game. 
  There was the ever returning Tunnel Hunt (that game that would not die.) There 
  were others but I do not recall them all right now.</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">What was the hardware like with 
  those early rasters?</font></p>
<font color="ff0000"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">The hardware was rather simple. 
  You have a number of "motion objects" which could be placed anywhere on the 
  screen. Early version simply took graphics from a PROM and the programmer simply 
  set a value in a register to select which picture. There were missile graphics, 
  2x2 or 1x1 objects to use as bullets. The playfield was a "stamp" based graphics 
  made up of 8x8 or 16x16 graphic stamps that were also pulled from a PROM. The 
  programmer stored a value to a memory map and each memory address displayed 
  one stamp.</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">How did the concept of Tunnel 
  Hunt evolve?</font></p>
<font color="#ffffff"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">Tunnel Hunt was actually my first 
  vector game, although it did not end up as a vector game. I really liked the 
  opening sequence of the movie Alien (the part where they landed) and thought 
  it might be fun. Using the vector system from Asteroids and some software from 
  Night Driver, I created a early version where you could fly down tunnels. But 
  because the system did not do hidden line removal, the tunnels could not move 
  much, It just did not work. A hardware engineer at Atari came up with an expensive 
  hardware that drew ellipses. I re-wrote the game to use that. It looked great. 
  Multiple tunnels with splits and rotates. But it was too expensive. Then the 
  hardware was changed to circles, but still too expensive. Then it was changed 
  to rectangles. That was what finally shipped. But marketing felt just flying 
  was not fun enough, so we added Star Wars like objects that flew down the tube 
  at you and you had to shoot them. It was a good game, but they kept wanting 
  changes. It did a solid #2 and #3 for 12 weeks in tests, but Atari could not 
  decide to ship it.</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">I personally thought Tunnel Hunt 
  was a great game. What led them to pawn it off on Exidy; who turned it down, 
  then later, Centuri; who released it?</font></p>
<font color="#ffffff"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">As above, it would just not earn 
  a #1 spot. I loved the game as well. So they decided to sell it to Exidy. They 
  tested it, and again #2! I guess they only wanted a game that was #1. It later 
  was sold to Centuri, but by then, it was way too old (at least 3 years out of 
  date). Why they sold it at all is beyond me.</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">Jed Margolin recently mentioned 
  a game you worked on called Sebring on Usenet. What is your recollection of 
  that game? Why wasn't it released?</font></p>
<font color="#ffffff"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">Ah politics. Sebring, I forgot 
  that game. There was a company that had just come out with a Mechanical game 
  called F-1. This was a driving game where they projected a circular track and 
  your car at the bottom. You had to drive the track and not hit the sides. Other 
  cars would come around the corner and you had to avoid them as well. OK, we 
  did this as a video game. We had a 25" monitor in a VERY large cabinet. The 
  monitor was actually ABOVE the player and reflected in a mirror that added a 
  3D like feel. It was great. We put it out on test and it did great as a 50 cents 
  game. New for that age. But Steve Calfee, my boss, was also working on driving 
  game and Atari marketing only wanted one driving game. It was kind of like SuperBug, 
  and overhead view driving game. His was cheaper but never earned above 3rd place 
  in the arcades. But guess who got to choose? </font><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">(NOTE: 
  Visit the <a href="sebring.html">Sebring</a> page to view Jed's description of the game.)</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">After Battlezone, you worked 
  on Space Duel, then Major Havoc; with Mark Cerny (Marble Madness). What kind 
  of input did he have? How did you two split up the work?</font></p>
<font color="#ffffff"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">I was already a year into Major 
  Havoc when Mark joined the game. He had (I guess still does have) a HUGE ego. 
  Even though he was very new at Atari at the time, he said he would not work 
  on the game unless he got an even say. I really did not care so I agreed. He 
  worked on one of the space waves (the flying fish) and the last 4 base ship 
  mazes. He also added some objects to the mazes (Like the gun and floating boots) 
  and helped clean up old items that never got shipped. We actually worked quite 
  well together. It was a lot of fun working with him, he really IS that good!</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">Did you work on any more games 
  at Atari after Major Havoc?</font></p>
<font color="#ffffff"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">Actually I quit before Havoc 
  shipped and they asked me to come back and finish it. I agreed. I then moved 
  to Rick Moncrief's group (now an officer at LBE) and worked on a golf simulator. 
  That was cool because you really hit a real ball into a net and we projected 
  the ball flying on the screen. We had lessons (it had a laser disk) and swing 
  analyzers as well. I quit in the middle of the project when Warner laid off 
  a bunch of people. I asked to leave.</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">When and why did you leave Atari?</font></p>
<font color="#ffffff"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">See above. They offered me almost 
  a year's pay to leave in 1984. I did on a Friday and joined Sente on the following 
  Monday!</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">What games did you work on at 
  Sente? How did the environment there differ from Atari?</font></p>
<font color="#ffffff"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">Well, I worked with ex-Atari 
  people. Although smaller, it was VERY similar. I worked on Goalie Ghost (a 1st 
  person Pong), a dating game, Name That Tune, and Shrike Avenger, a real motion 
  simulator game. I also helped on several other games and was also their Systems 
  Manager for the Vax development system.</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">What eventually led you out of 
  the games business, and where did you go?</font></P>
<font color="#ffffff"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">Bally decided to shut down Sente, 
  so I got laid off, I had replaced the large Vax with PCs for each developer, 
  so I was not needed for that. And they only wanted 2 game designers and the 
  two they kept were better at it than me. I left and went to Interactive Productions, 
  a Rob Fulop start-up to do video/graphics projects (multimedia BEFORE it was 
  called multimedia!) I designed a game system for Quantum Computing (now AOL!) 
  that lets games play on multiple machines. Rabbit Jack's Casino was built on 
  this platform. But that lasted only 6 months and Apple made me an offer and 
  I was there!</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">How did it feel to be working 
  on arcade games during the "golden age" of gaming?</font></p>
<font color="#ffffff"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">This could take a whole page 
  to say. The simple answer: it was fun and VERY hard work. In those days we were 
  the game designer, the software engineer, the sound designer, the graphic artists, 
  the tester, etc. Later games added some of these people, but usually the projects 
  were only 1 or 2 people, 3 to 4 at the end.</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">Do you retain any rights to the 
  games you worked on?</font></p>
<font color="#ffffff"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">I wish!</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">Do you play any of your old games? 
  Do you have any cabinets in your possession?</font></p>
<font color="#ffffff"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">I play some on the Mame emulator 
  on the Mac, and I have a Major Havoc and a Space Duel at home still. I play 
  them both.</font></p>
<font color="00ff00"> 
<p><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode">Last question: What's the best 
  drug to be on when playing Tunnel Hunt (this wasn't my idea, I swear! Heh :)?</font></p>
<font color="#000000" size="2" face="lucida sans unicode"> 
<p>I use to get that question a lot. In fact, I was often asked what drug I was 
  on when I made it. No drugs necessary actually. If you stare straight at the 
  middle for too long a time, it will make you quite dizzy! Maybe that is why 
  it was called Vertigo when Exidy had it!<br>
