      <b>PT Commander - 1978 Atari Inc.</b><br>
      <br>
      This game was never released.<br>
      <br>
      If I recall, this game was started by someone else, I cannot recall who
      it was however. The game idea was two "PT" boats on opposite sides of the
      screen, who would drive out and either attack each other or attack the
      other person's dock. But you could only hold two torpedoes and had to return
      to the dock to get another. Unless of course, your dock was blown up.<br>
      <br>
      I recall we used some graphics for the dock, illuminated with a half sliver
      mirror, so the boats appeared to rise over the graphics. We had incandescent
      lamps that could be controlled by software, and used them to show off the
      explosion of the docks.<br>
      <br>
      As you can imagine, the game was not much fun!
