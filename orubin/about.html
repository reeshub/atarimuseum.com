<b>Skills & Experience Summary at a glance:</b><br><br>

I have a very wide range of technical and business skills in Engineering, Operations, and Business Development. I am an experienced division, department and team manager leading teams of all kinds, with experience of teams over 30 people, and up to 10 direct reports at one time. I am also very experienced in technical new business development, creation and management of technical, video and multimedia production departments, digital TV systems, STB designs, cable head end systems and networks. In my experience I have been a software and hardware architect and engineer, broadband engineer, broadband researcher, project leader, systems integrator, researcher, LAN designer and implementer for wired and wireless netwroks, and have also done work in human interface standards and designs, real-time video graphics, OS, and ROM based firmware as well. I have over 18 years of software design and programming experience, and well over 8 years in broadband engineering and management with experience in HFC and wireless broadband systems as well as designing and deploying Set Top Boxes, Interactive TV systems, and Cable Modem systems. I have helped deploy several such systems as well. I have over 14 years of multimedia design and development experience. At Apple, I designed or helped design new Macintosh CPUs and Apple IIGS systems, OS and toolbox software, ROM firmware, installer scripts, and system bring-up. I have also other OS design and implementation experience including device and video drivers and interrupt handlers, and I have Systems Management experience in supporting UNIX , PC, Macintosh, and VAX/VMS systems, networks, desktop support and remote access systems. I believe my wide range of experiences makes me an ideal candidate for upper management in a wide range of positions.<br><br>
