              a living,&quot; one of the pack admits. &quot;For me,&quot; says
              another, &quot;a tough day is trying to find those two little bugs
              in my game, so I spend hours playing it. Sometime, of course, you
              have to spend hours pushing a pencil. And for most people here,
              pushing a pencil is the most aggravating thing they could do.&quot;</font>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other labs are springing to life
                now, as more programmers and engineers say hello to their computers
                and ask what is on their simulated minds. Pushing open a door,
                I step into an unearthly greenhouse sprouting wires that climb
                the walls like clematis vines. An engineer who looks more like
                the gardener in faded jeans and boots is hunched almost into
                a video tube, his shirttails mentally flying as the computer
                bests him. Suddenly he pounds the control panel with his fists. &quot;We
                stress-test all our games pretty thoroughly before they leave
                here,&quot; he announces wryly.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">Across the lab, a programmer in blue
                bib overalls is scratching a bird's nest of hair and swearing
                at his computer. On a shelf in front of him, a little vehicle
                has just gone haywire on the graphics display monitor. He types
                out a new instruction, pushes a control button, and watches intently. &quot;It
                disappeared!&quot; he sputters. &quot;I know I didn't blow it
                up, so something else blew up! Like the program!&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">The gardener comes over to commiserate. &quot;Is
                it breaking down?&quot; he asks. &quot;It hasn't become sane
                yet!&quot; the programmer moans. &quot;I have yet to convince
                it to speak anything that's even a semblance of reality!&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">One door down, things are working
                better. A wavy-haired woman in rosy velour and jeans spins a
                control ball with long slender fingers to move images around </font></td>

              Dona may go down in the annals of computer science as the programmer
              who turned animations of centipedes and spiders into objects of
              female fantasy. &quot;I'm convinced my game is a woman's game,&quot;she
              says, with a soft Arkansas laugh. &quot;It's a nice game. It's
              very straightforward.&quot;</font>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like Dave, who yearned to work for
                Atari from the moment he saw the original Pong game in a bar,
                Dona was drawn to Atari by playing games in an arcade. She was
                working at General Motors' Delco plant in Santa Barbara, programming
                a microprocessor to govern such things as idle speed, spark advance
                and cruise control in the 1981 Cadillac. But GM's assembly-line
                approach to programming was frustrating (&quot;Sometimes even
                two programmers is one too many&quot;) and the days were dull. &quot;At
                GM, you could whisper if you had to, but don't talk and for God's
                sake, don't laugh,&quot; she says.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">So she escaped to a nearby arcade
                at lunchtime, out of boredom: &quot;I knew about the Silicon
                Valley, everybody talked about it, but I read somewhere about
                Atari being up here and it just dawned on me: 'They make these
                games. What they do every day is what I do every day, but look
                what they get out of it. I get Cadillacs and they get these!' &quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is it about these games? When
                Asteroids was still in the lab, on its way to becoming Atari's
                most popular game ever, Lyle was the force who helped make it
                work. &quot;I was also,&quot; he admits, &quot;the original Asteroids
                junkie. By junkie I mean I would go into the lab after work at
                five or six in the evening and start playing Asteroids, and when
                I would finally snap out</font></td>
