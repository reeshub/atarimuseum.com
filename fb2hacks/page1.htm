<p align="center"><font face="Arial">First thing is to remove the 5 philips head
screws from underneath the console.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 of them are underneath
labels.&nbsp;&nbsp; One is the Warranty Warning tamper label, the second is in
the center of the product ID label.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">After you lift off the top half of the
console case you can now see inside of the console and the PCB
board.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Main Board is held in place by 6 screws, the
Difficult Switches board is held in place by 2 screws and the Power Switch board
is held in place by 2 screws.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly the AV cable
is held in place under a tension retainer stalk with 1 screw and washer.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="pcb-cartmod-legend.gif" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">To assist in your Cartridge Mod additional
to the console, a legend was silk-screened onto the board for easy
reference.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will move a jumper wire from the IC2 ROM chip to the
other side of the C4 pin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On J3 you'll need to close the
jumper - you will have a choice here on whether you want to make it permanent or
not, this will be discussed more later.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Remove ALL of the screws and carefully
slide the board towards the front of the console and then angle it up and out
out of its place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the Power and Difficulty Switches
all have springs between the plastic button caps and the boards, so they may
spring out, keep a close eye on all three (3) of them.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="inside-view-1.gif" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">So here is the Inside View of the Flashback
2 console with the PCB now removed as well as all of the switch buttons and
springs.</font></p>
