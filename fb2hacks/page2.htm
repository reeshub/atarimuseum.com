<p align="center"><font face="Arial">This is the area we will be focusing
on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This area of the board is where all of the
connections and mods will take place to allow the use of real cartridges on the
system.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pcb-closeup1.gif" width="964" height="504"></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">Locate all 24 Cartridge pinout
connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The board is silk-screened to show
pin # for each cartridge port connection, however the above image has all of the
solder points highlighted in RED.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Points 1, 17, 18, 19
and 23 can be a little difficult to locate and to be certain which one is which,
so the above image clearly ID's all of the cartridge point
points.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These pads are small so take
your time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tin the solder points first to make it easier to
attach the wire to each point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a desoldering iron on hand
in case you accidentally &quot;bridge&quot; two solder pads together.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">You will move the Black wire from
IC2 to the other side of C4, then at J3 you'll need to add a
jumper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recommend you buy a single pull, single throw (SPST)
Toggle switch and wire it across J3, this will allow you to enable/disable the
onboard ROM chip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the IC2 C4 connection a 3 way
switch wired to the black wire on the common and one wire to the original
location and an additional wire to C4 will allow you to switch from the original
wire run to the C4 run.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll need to drill open 2 holes for
your two toggle switches.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its some extra work, but worth it
since you'll be able to continue using the 40 built in games and then switch to
using cartridges when needed. </font></p>
