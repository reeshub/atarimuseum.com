<p align="center"><img border="0" src="cartmod-parts.gif" width="500" height="375"></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Soldering iron (15-20 watt), thin solder
will be needed along with wire cutters, I recommend a desoldering tool and some
solder braid to help out if you make a mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A desktop set
of PCB board holders is a good tool to have on hand when doing this kind of
work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure you have good bright lighting to work by.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">You'll need a PC component board which is
available at most Radio Shacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A flat ribbon cable is
my recommendation for you wire connections, it'll be cleaner and easier to work
with, the wire is general 28-32guage so stripping the wires is a very delicate
procedure, take your time.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">The 2600 cartridge connector and (Optional)
cartridge guide can be obtained from:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="cartboard1.jpg" width="500" height="375"></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">I would really recommend the plastic guide
if you plan to make a really presentable cosmetic mod to the top of the console
case to allow you to place cartridges into the slot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll
need to trim the PC Component Board and make the appropriate drill holes so you
can screw the PC component board the underside of the Cartridge Guide
Plastic.&nbsp; (IMPORTANT NOTE - Be sure you do this BEFORE soldering the
cartridge connector to the PC Component board so you have the correct height of
the cartridge connector underneath the Cartridge Guide
Plastic.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can use an Atari 7800 Cartridge connector
as well, but you'll need the 7800 cartridge guide plastic.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="cartboard2.gif" width="500" height="375"></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Atariage.com maintains the most up to date
Atari 2600 FAQ.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this FAQ you will find the cartridge connector
Pinouts for the 2600.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After you solder your Cartridge
Connector for the PC Component Board.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark the 4 corners of the
underside of the cartridge pins 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
24&nbsp;&nbsp; So you'll know where your going.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I split the
ribbon cable down in half about 4 inches of so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One side was
pins 1 through 12, then continuing I soldered 13 through 24.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">I would recommend you use a voltmeter and
double check all of the pins the end of the ribbon cable and make sure you have
a solid connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next thing, put the meter (set to
check for a closed circuit with audio beep) and put one lead onto pin 1, then
with the lead and go from pin 2 through 24, if not beep, then move to pin 2 and
go from 3 to 24 and repeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will help you make certain
you did bridge any of the cartridge pins together by accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you get a beep and a closed circuit with 2 pins, check them and correct as
needed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">When attaching each wire to the PCB start
at 1 and work your way across the ribbon cable, you'll need to trim the
insulation about no more then 1/16th of inch for each wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Again double-check for shorts/bridges and correct if needed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Set your Toggle switches to the 40 in 1 ROM
and test the unit to see if the Menu appears, POWER OFF, now switch the toggle
switches and insert a cartridge and Power up, you are now using original 2600
cartridges.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the screen is black or filled with garbage you may
have the cartridge backwards, POWER OFF, turn it around and try
again.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your game cart is not working, double-check your
connections and the order of your wires to the cartridge connector
pins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If its still not working, try your console with a cart
like Combat, Breakout, Adventure, something simple and ensure you are not
encountering any issues.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">I've only done the electronics side, I
haven't had time to do the cosmetic version yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically
you'll need to make an opening with a dremel or other hobbyist cutting tool on
the top center of the console and slide the Cartridge Guide plastic into place,
it has a lip around it so its sit flush, apply some plastic bonding glue to
permanently attach it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now put the cartridge PC board
into place under it, screw in the two retaining screws to secure the cartridge
board to the plastic guide, and carefully reassemble your Flashback 2
console.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you did the toggle switch mod, slide the switch
masts through 2 holes in the back bottom of the console plastic and secure the
holding nuts into place and tighten.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once your console is assembled,
test it with the toggle switches in the 40 in 1 ROM position and make sure the
normal Flashback Menu appears, if all is well, now POWER OFF, switch the toggle
switches and test a cartridge.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">One last note - I have NOT tested the
console with a multicart or Maxi26 or any of the more power-hungry cartridges,
so try those at your own additional risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy hacking/modding!!!</font></p>
