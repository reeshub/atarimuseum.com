<font size="2" face="Arial">INDUSTRY DOUBTS ATARI'S NEW STRATEGY</font></b></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="1" face="Arial">Reprinted from New York Times.&nbsp; May 13, 1985</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">ATLANTA, May 8th, --&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari Corporation made an 
unexpected appearance at the Comdex personal computer trade show here to 
convince a sceptical industry that the company was viable and that its new 
products would soon come to market. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">But after two days of statements that seemed 
contradictory, vague promises about the future of a new computer and sketchy 
descriptions of future models, there seemed to be more doubters than ever.
</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We've seen marketing strategies changed before our 
eyes,&quot; said Barbam Isgur, an analyst and consultant who follows the consumer 
electronics industry, as she emerged from an Atari meeting. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">Others expressed amazement that Jack Tramiel, 
Atari’s tough-acting and unpredictable owner, was still the center of industry 
attention, even while his products and his company faced an uncertain fate.</font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

<b><font size="2">Ousted From Commodore</font></b><font size="2"> </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tramiel bought the company from Warner 
Communications Inc. last year, after he was ousted as chief executive of 
Commodore International Ltd., Atari’s archrival.&nbsp; The deal involved no cash, and 
gave Warner a 32 percent stake in the company.&nbsp; The company bears little 
resemblance to its old self.&nbsp; Mr. Tramiel has replaced all of the executives and 
is rapidly replacing the product line. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everywhere that Mr. Tramiel went in the 
sprawling Georgia World Congress Center, where the Comdex show was held, he 
seemed to leave a trail of confusion.&nbsp; Most of it concerned an innovative, new 
home computer, called the Atari 520ST.&nbsp; Like Commodore's forthcoming Amiga 
computer - which was shown only to a select few in a hotel room near the 
conference --- the Atari machine sports the fancy graphics and easy-to use 
features of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh.&nbsp; Both will sell for about a third 
of the Macintosh's price. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">The Atari computer's graphics are stunning, and 
unlike the Macintosh, it works in color.&nbsp; Many in the decimated home computer 
and software industry are rooting for Atari, hoping it will make consumers 
excited about computers once again. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Atari's first promise is already going 
sour.&nbsp; Early in the year, Mr. Tramiel said shipment of the 520SL would begin by 
April - a statement Atari now denies was made - but at Comdex the shipping date 
became July.&nbsp; With July two months away, it was still not clear where those 
shipments would be headed. . In January, when he first showed the computer, Mr. 
Tramiel said the 520SL would be sold in the same manner as previous Atari and 
Commodore home machines: through mass marketers such as K Mart and Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.
<br>
&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10"><font face="Arial">
<b><font size="2">Plan Is Changed</font></b><font size="2"> </font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">But by last Monday, the plan had suddenly changed.&nbsp; 
Mr. Tramiel said the machine was too complex for un-trained salesmen and 
competed with far more expensive models, so it would be sold through computer 
specialty stores, alongside IBM PC's and Apples. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a news conference on Tuesday, he changed 
the plan again.&nbsp; The sophisticated version would be sold in specialty stores, 
and a stripped-down, less-powerful model, the 520ST, never before publicly 
mentioned would be on mass-marketers' shelves by August.&nbsp; &quot;The press seems to 
have trouble getting this right,&quot; Mr. Tramiel said. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">When Atari officials were asked at the news 
conference to list the computer dealers that would be handling the 520ST when 
volume shipments begin in July, they could not name one. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">As a result, few in the industry believe they will 
ever see production models of the 520ST.&nbsp; And those who do, doubt that it will 
happen any time soon. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer specialty stores have been shy of 
Mr. Tramiel since his Commodore days, when he first sold his inexpensive 
computers through them, then abruptly provided the products to discounters.&nbsp; 
That left the specialty stores with large inventories of overpriced machines, 
and few warm feelings for Mr. Tramiel.&nbsp; In the absence of many other computers 
to offer home users, however, especially after the demise of IBM’s PCjr, 
retailers may have no choice but to deal with Mr. Tramiel. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;IBM and Apple are really not treating the low end 
of the market right,&quot; said William E. Ladin Jr., chairman of Computer craft, a 
chain of 61 computer stores in the Southwest.&nbsp; &quot;Jack Tramiel has the right 
idea.&nbsp; I'd like to see it all work out.&nbsp; &quot; </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Mr. Ladin, however, worries whether it 
is worth the effort to sell an $800 machine.&nbsp; &quot;It took far more hand holding and 
explaining to sell a PCjr to a first-time customer for $800 than to sell a $5000 
PC-AT to a veteran,&quot; Mr. Ladin said, recalling IBM’s Christmas promotion of the 
PCjr.&nbsp; &quot;We sold a bunch, but my salesmen hated me.&quot; </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">Software is another problem for Atari.&nbsp; While the 
new Atari machine is similar to the Macintosh, it uses an entirely different 
operating system, called Gem, that was designed by Digital Research Inc. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari officials assert that more than 100 
software titles will be available for the machine, most written by small 
software houses that desperately need work.&nbsp; At the show on Monday, Sigmund 
Hartmann, a former Commodore executive brought in by Mr. Tramiel to head the 
software effort, also hinted that the prestigious Microsoft International Inc. 
might be preparing a program or two for the Atari machine.&nbsp; &quot;We're shipping them 
a machine and they're real interested,&quot; he said. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But on Tuesday, Microsoft's chairman, 
William Gates, said, &quot;At this point, we have no plans for the Atari machine, 
nothing under development&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atari's future may be ultimately determined by its 
finances, not its new products.&nbsp; The company's financial situation is poor, 
because sales of Atari's old line are &quot;very, very slow,&quot; Mr. Tramiel said, in 
part because of continuing legal&nbsp; wrangles with Warner and Commodore.&nbsp; A lack of 
funds could slow development of two other long-promised Atari products: a 32-bit 
computer for business use, which the company has yet to show, and a $500 compact 
disk reader - similar to those used for high-quality music recordings - that, 
can store vast amounts of information. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We'll have them by fall,&quot; Mr. Tramiel said, 
adding that the compact disk drive would make it possible to put encyclopaedias, 
legal casebooks and patents in electronic form, all available to consumers for a 
relatively low price.&nbsp; &quot;My slogan is the best value and the highest technology, 
and that is what I will deliver.&quot; </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
<font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tramiel is a tough competitor, and while 
he rarely delivers all that he promises, he has always delivered something.&nbsp; Not 
everyone is willing to write him off. <br>
&quot;Obviously, they are having pains,&quot; said Dick Bratt, vice president of 
engineering and development for Spinnaker Software, a Cambridge, Mass., concern 
writing programs for the company.&nbsp; &quot;There's a temptation to jump on the coffin 
and start spitting nails in.&nbsp; But Jack Tramiel is a winner.&nbsp; I wouldn't bet 
against him.&quot; </font></p>
