<p>Q: Previous maintainers.
<p>A: A. Karl Heller (heller@cdnow.com) maintained the 2600 FAQ up to version
<br>11, and co-maintained it up to and including version 11.5. The classic
<br>community owes him a large debt of gratitude for his efforts.
<p>Karl also deserves high praise for graciously stepping aside when his
<br>interest in maintaining this FAQ waned. Karl allowed me to improve
his
<br>creation (starting with version 11) without becoming angry or possessive.
I
<br>sincerely hope that I am as gracious as he when it is my turn to pass
this

<p>Q: What information is missing from the FAQ?
<p>A: Bunches of stuff, some of which includes:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * confirmation of baud rate for Gameline modem
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * 7800 encryption code (ha ha)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Any link found in the dead links file
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~dzubera/2600deadlinks.html).
These links
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worked in previous versions of the FAQ, but
have been relegated to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dead links file until I can find out where
they went.
<p>Q: Where can I find the latest version of this FAQ?
<p>A: The FAQ (http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~dzubera/2600faq.html) is maintained
<br>in html form and is amended as updates come in. Every so often (when
there
<br>is enough new material), the html version is converted to text, edited
a
<br>bit, and posted to rec.games.video.classic, rec.games.video.atari,
<br>rec.answers and news.answers. The text version
<br>(http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~dzubera/2600faq.txt) is on the Web as
well,
<br>but it is updated only before posting to Usenet.
<p>Q: What Usenet groups discuss or are relevant to the 2600/7800?
<p>A: There are several groups:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * rec.games.video.classic
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * rec.games.video.marketplace
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * rec.games.video.atari
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * alt.atari.2600
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * alt.atari.2600vcs
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * alt.atari.2600.programming
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * alt.atari.2600.vcs
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * alt.games.atari
<p>rec.games.video.classic (rgvc) is probably the best place to start,
as it is
<br>carried in most newsfeeds and generally has the most traffic.
<br>rec.games.video.marketplace is for the buying and selling of video
games and
<br>systems and is not limited to atari or even classic systems. It is
dominated
<br>by post-classic ads, which is why you will often see buy/sell/auction
posts
<br>in rgvc. rec.games.video.atari usually contains Jaguar discussion,
but will
<br>occasionally digress into 2600/7800 discussion when it pertains to
the
<br>Jaguar (e.g. Tempest 2000). The five atari alt groups are not carried
by
<br>many newsfeeds; consequently, the traffic in these groups is minimal.
<p>Do not post to alt.2600 or any of its subgroups about the Atari 2600/7800.
<br>That group is for discussion of hacking and phreaking and you will
probably
<br>get flamed if you do.
<p>If you don't have a newsfeed at your site, but do have a newsreader
(most
<br>web browsers have one built in), you can still get access to some,
if not
<br>all of these groups. See the List of Open NNTP servers
<br>(http://oloon.student.utwente.nl/open_nntp.html) page for a list of
places
<br>where you might point your browser to see the rgvc groups.
<p>Many of these servers have only a limited number of groups, so if the
one
<br>you choose doesn't carry rgvc, try another. Another possible solution
is
<br>newsone.net (http://newsone.net), which does carry all of the 2600
related
<br>news groups. Make sure you use the "frames mode," or you'll get a new
<br>browser window for each news article.
<p>Maintainer's note: www.feedme.org used to be recommended, but disappeared
<br>without a trace.
<p>Q: What is the rec.games.video.classic charter?
<p>A: We have uncovered the following:
<p>rec.games.video.classic is an unmoderated newsgroup which passed its
<br>vote for creation by 257:85 as reported in news.announce.newgroups
on
<br>13 Apr 1993.
<p>And from the second Call for Votes
<br>(ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/news.announce.newgroups/rec/rec.games.video-reorg),
<p>these bits:
<p>5) Should a newsgroup rec.games.video.classic be created?
<p>This newsgroup would carry discussions regarding older, "classic" home
<br>video entertainment systems like the Atari 2600, Coleco, Intellivision,
<br>etc.&nbsp; This newsgroup would supersede alt.games.video.classic.
<p>Finally, for those of you wondering if buy/sell/auction posts are
<br>discouraged on groups other than rec.games.video.marketplace, consider
the
<br>following:
<p>3) Should a newsgroup rec.games.video.marketplace be created?
<p>This newsgroup would carry offers to sell and requests to buy home video
<br>entertainment products and accessories like systems, cartridges, etc.
<p>The netiquette of the rec.games.video.* hierarchy would request that
<br>people NOT cross-post buy/sell discussions to other rec.games.video.*
<br>newsgroups.
<p>Q: Are there any mailing lists that discuss the 2600/7800?
<p>A: There are at least three. Jeremy Wilson (xeno@inforamp.net) runs
the
<br>classic videogames mailing list, which covers both home and arcade
classic
<br>games. To subscribe, mail listserv@moose.to with the following message
body:
<p>subscribe classic-videogames your@email.address Your Name
<p>There is also a UK Classic Videogame mailing list; ian@planetbuilders.co.uk
<br>for subscribe requests, ccnuk@onelist.com for the list itself. For
more
<br>information, see this link (http://www.gyruss.demon.co.uk/ccnuk/).
The above
<br>page also contains a database of classic UK collectors. There is also
a
<br>separate UK list (ccnukfst@onelist.com) exclusively for sale and trade
<br>posts; ian@planetbuilders.co.uk for subscription requests to that list
as
<br>well.
<p>The Stella mailing list (also know as the Starpath CD mailing list and
the
<br>Atari 2600 Programming list) is for those using the Starpath CD development
<br>tools to write 2600 games. To subscribe, mail majordomo@biglist.com
with the
<br>following in the message body:
<p>subscribe stella your@email.address
<p>The informational snippet for this list is as follows.
<p>"This list was designed as as support group for Starpath CD owners who
are
<br>writing 2600 games through the developer software. It is hoped that
TOGETHER
<br>we can write some new games for the 2600. Exchanging uuencoded binaries
is
<br>okay as long as it's in BIN form, not WAV."
<p>Q: Where can I find cart lists?
<p>A: VGR (vgr@clark.net) maintains the giant 2600/7800 list which contains
<br>entries for most 2600/7800 games, although it has not been updated
in a
<br>while. In addition to manufacturer's model number, the list also includes
<br>rarity ratings. Here is the plain text version
<br>(http://www.clark.net/pub/vgr/lists/plain/atari) and the html table
version
<br>(http://www.clark.net/pub/vgr/lists/ht/atari/ataritoc.html).
<p>Dean Dierschow (dean@xocolatl.com) maintains game lists
<br>(http://www.xocolatl.com/carts/) for several systems including the
<br>2600/7800. The relevant files are at2600.lst, at5200.lst, and at7800.lst.
<br>These lists are a good starting point for the new or general game collector;
<br>alas, these files have not been updated since Oct 94.
<p>The Giant List of 2600 Label Variations is for all of the sick collectors
<br>who want to know label differences in excruciating detail. John Earney
<br>(jearney@best.com) maintains the list
<br>(http://www.best.com/~jearney/lists/labelsv5.txt), which looks like
this:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cosmic Ark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
